- Throughout, you refer to “mean coalescence time” as just “coalescence time”.  I think that it is important to emphasise that you are focussing on a distance matrix, which discards a great deal of information, in particular, from the distribution of coalescence times.
- Having said that, the distance matrix is essentially the covariance of allele frequencies; if one assumes that allele frequencies are approximately Gaussian distributed, this covariance contains all the information that one could use for estimation. This is a roundabout argument taht one may bnit be able to do better than using a distance matrix.
- Ringbauer et al use that approach, not shared haplotypes.  We bootstrap across loci, which is probably more robust than using an approximate Gaussian likelihood (I don’t recall whether we compared these two ways to estimate uncertainty).
- You focus on the effects of a consistently asymmetric migration.  Even more problematic would be flows that change over time (as with extinction & recolonisation). The difficulty is really that there are far too many parameters, and it’s not clear that there are simpler “effective” models that would be tractable.
- I worry about whether Eq 8 really captures the uncertainty in the model.  At any one locus, there will be strong correlations arising from the shared genealogy, so the different D_ij will be correlated.  This will average out with enough independent loci, but nevertheless, one can’t assume that the estimation errors in the distance matrix are uncorrelated.    This could be checked just by seeing whether your approach correctly captures the variance in estimators.
- Was the MCMC method on p6 necessary ? The forwards simulations that follow seem more appropriate.
- Tufto et al. (Genetics 1998) estimate a migration model using a framework similar to yours.
- It’s not clear to me what the parameter range you simulate - the “coalescence rate” is rathe abstract. One expects typically small Fst,  which may correspond to low coalescence rates, but what Fst do you simulate?
p16 - Producing maps of higher resolution is hardly an advantage if they are spurious.  You are a bit to polite about resistance methods - and the paper doesn’t make clear enough how far estimates from either resistance or genetic models correspond to reality.  In Ringbauer et al. (2018), there seemed to be very weak power to detect a barrier.
