  abstract = {Genetic data often exhibit patterns that are broadly consistent with "isolation by distance" - a phenomenon where genetic similarity tends to decay with geographic distance. In a heterogeneous habitat, decay may occur more quickly in some regions than others: for example, barriers to gene flow can accelerate the genetic differentiation between groups located close in space. We use the concept of "effective migration" to model the relationship between genetics and geography: in this paradigm, effective migration is low in regions where genetic similarity decays quickly. We present a method to quantify and visualize variation in effective migration across the habitat, which can be used to identify potential barriers to gene flow, from geographically indexed large-scale genetic data. Our approach uses a population genetic model to relate underlying migration rates to expected pairwise genetic dissimilarities, and estimates migration rates by matching these expectations to the observed dissimilarities. We illustrate the potential and limitations of our method using simulations and data from elephant, human, and Arabidopsis thaliana populations.  The resulting visualizations highlight important features of the spatial population structure that are difficult to discern using existing methods for summarizing genetic variation such as principal components analysis.Received November 25, 2014.Accepted November 26, 2014. 2014, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressThis pre-print is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International), CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, as described at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/},

	abstract = {The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) provided research funds to study the conservation genomics and landscape genomics of the Mojave desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizii, in response to the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP). To do this, we consolidated tissue samples of the desert tortoise from across the species range within California and southern Nevada, generated a DNA dataset consisting of full genomes of 270 tortoises, and analyzed the way in which the environment of the desert tortoise has determined modern patterns of relatedness and genetic diversity across the landscape. Here we present the implications of these results for the conservation and landscape genomics of the desert tortoise. Our work strongly indicates that several well-defined genetic groups exist within the species, including a primary north-south genetic discontinuity at the Ivanpah Valley and another separating western from eastern Mojave samples. We also use existing desert tortoise habitat modeling data with a novel extension of genetic "resistance distance" using geographic maps of continuous space to predict the relative impacts of five proposed development alternatives within the DRECP and rank them with respect to their likely impacts on desert tortoise gene flow and connectivity in the Mojave. Finally, we analyzed the impacts of each of the 214 distinct proposed development area "chunks", derived from the proposed development polygons, and ranked each chunk in terms of its range-wide impacts on desert tortoise gene flow.},

@article{klopfstein2006mutations,
  abstract = {Many species, including humans, have dramatically expanded their range in the past, and such range expansions had certainly an impact on their genetic diversity. For example, mutations arising in populations at the edge of a range expansion can sometimes surf on the wave of advance and thus reach a larger spatial distribution and a much higher frequency than would be expected in stationary populations. We study here this surfing phenomenon in more detail, by performing extensive computer simulations under a two-dimensional stepping-stone model. We find that the probability of survival of a new mutation depends to a large degree on its proximity to the edge of the wave. Demographic factors such as deme size, migration rate, and local growth rate also influence the fate of these new mutations. We also find that the final spatial and frequency distributions depend on the local deme size of a subdivided population. This latter result is discussed in the light of human expansions in Europe as it should allow one to distinguish between mutations having spread with Paleolithic or Neolithic expansions. By favoring the spread of new mutations, a consequence of the surfing phenomenon is to increase the rate of evolution of spatially expanding populations.},

@article{greven2004representation,
  abstract = {We consider spatially interacting Moran models and their diffusion limit which are interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions. The Moran model is a spatial population model with individuals of different type located on sites given by elements of an Abelian group. The dynamics of the system consists of independent migration of individuals between the sites and a resampling mechanism at each site, i.e., pairs of individuals are replaced by new pairs where each newcomer takes the type of a randomly chosen individual from the parent pair. Interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions collect the relative frequency of a subset of types evaluated for the separate sites in the limit of infinitely many individuals per site. One is interested in the type configuration as well as the time-space evolution of genealogies, encoded in the so-called historical process. The first goal of the paper is the analytical characterization of the historical processes for both models as solutions of well-posed martingale problems and the development of a corresponding duality theory.  For that purpose, we link both the historical Fisher-Wright diffusions and the historical Moran models by the so-called look-down process. That is, for any fixed time, a collection of historical Moran models with increasing particle intensity and a particle representation for the limiting historical interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions are provided on one and the same probability space. This leads to a strong form of duality between spatially interacting Moran models, interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions on the one hand and coalescing random walks on the other hand, which extends the classical weak form of moment duality for interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions.  Our second goal is to show that this representation can be used to obtain new results on the long-time behavior,  in particular (i) on the structure of the equilibria, and of the equilibrium historical processes, and (ii) on the behavior of our  models on large but finite site space in comparison with our models on infinite site space. Here the so-called finite system scheme is established for spatially interacting Moran models which implies via the look-down representation also the already known results for interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions. Furthermore suitable versions of the finite system scheme on the level of historical processes are newly developed and verified.  In the long run the provided look-down representation is intended to answer questions about finer path properties of interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions.},

like the log of the number of colonies. In the other direction, our formulas
show that there is significant spatial structure in parts of parameter space

The partition elements of the spatial $\Lambda$-coalescent migrate in a (finite) geographical space and may only coalesce if located at the same site of the space. We characterize the $\Lambda$-coalescents that come down from infinity, in an analogous way to Schweinsberg (2000). Surprisingly, all spatial coalescents that come down from infinity, also come down from infinity in a uniform way. This enables us to study space-time asymptotics of spatial $\Lambda$-coalescents on large tori in $d\geq 3$ dimensions.

@article{heuer2013spatial,
  abstract = {We consider the genealogy of a sample of individuals taken from a spatially structured population when the variance of the offspring distribution is relatively large. The space is structured into discrete sites of a graph G . If the population size at each site is large, spatial coalescents with multiple mergers, so called spatial Λ -coalescents, for which ancestral lines migrate in space and coalesce according to some Λ -coalescent mechanism, are shown to be appropriate approximations to the genealogy of a sample of individuals. We then consider as the graph G the two dimensional torus with side length 2 L + 1 and show that as L tends to infinity, and time is rescaled appropriately, the partition structure of spatial Λ -coalescents of individuals sampled far enough apart converges to the partition structure of a non-spatial Kingman coalescent. From a biological point of view this means that in certain circumstances both the spatial structure as well as larger variances of the underlying offspring distribution are harder to detect from the sample. However, supplemental simulations show that for moderately large L the different structure is still evident. },

collide one or the other of them must have already collided with each particle
that was initially between them. We investigate whether such instantaneous
coalescence still occurs for coalescing systems of particles where either the
state space of the individual particles is not locally homeomorphic to an
interval or the sample paths of the individual particles are discontinuous. We
give a quite general criterion for a coalescing system of particles on a
compact state space to coalesce to a finite set at all positive times almost
surely and show that there is almost sure instantaneous coalescence to a
locally finite set for systems of Brownian motions on the Sierpinski gasket and
stable processes on the real line with stable index greater than one.},

Here we show that a stepping-stone model has a more pronounced effect on the genealogy of a sample. For samples from a small geographical region commonly used in genetic studies of humans and Drosophila, there is a shift of the frequency spectrum that decreases the number of low-frequency-derived alleles and skews the distribution of statistics of Tajima, Fu and Li, and Fay and Wu. Stepping-stone spatial structure also changes the two-locus sampling distribution and increases both linkage disequilibrium and the probability that two sites are perfectly correlated. This may cause a false prediction of cold spots of recombination and may confuse haplotype tests that compute probabilities on the basis of a homogeneously mixing population.},

The diploid, monoecious population occupies a finite chain of equally spaced colonies; generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; mating is random in each colony.

This problem is studied for two alleles and constant and uniform population density and drift and diffusion coefficients.

@article{barton2013inference,
  abstract = {Abstract
We outline two approaches to inference of neighbourhood size, N , and dispersal rate, σ 2 , based on either allele frequencies or on the lengths of sequence blocks that are shared between genomes. Over intermediate timescales (10–100 generations, say), populations that live in two dimensions approach a quasi-equilibrium that is independent of both their local structure and their deeper history. Over such scales, the standardised covariance of allele frequencies (i.e. pairwise F S T ) falls with the logarithm of distance, and depends only on neighbourhood size, N , and a ‘local scale’, κ ; the rate of gene flow, σ 2 , cannot be inferred. We show how spatial correlations can be accounted for, assuming a Gaussian distribution of allele frequencies, giving maximum likelihood estimates of N and κ . Alternatively, inferences can be based on the distribution of the lengths of sequence that are identical between blocks of genomes: long blocks (&gt;0.1 cm, say) tell us about intermediate timescales, over which we assume a quasi-equilibrium. For large neighbourhood size, the distribution of long blocks is given directly by the classical Wright–Malécot formula; this relationship can be used to infer both N and σ 2 . With small neighbourhood size, there is an appreciable chance that recombinant lineages will coalesce back before escaping into the distant past. For this case, we show that if genomes are sampled from some distance apart, then the distribution of lengths of blocks that are identical in state is geometric, with a mean that depends on N and σ 2 .},

@article{barton2013genetic,
  abstract = {When a mutation with selective advantage s spreads through a panmictic population, it may cause two lineages at a linked locus to coalesce; the probability of coalescence is exp ( - 2 r T ) , where T ∼ log ( 2 N s ) / s is the time to fixation, N is the number of haploid individuals, and r is the recombination rate. Population structure delays fixation, and so weakens the effect of a selective sweep. However, favourable alleles spread through a spatially continuous population behind a narrow wavefront; ancestral lineages are confined at the tip of this front, and so coalesce rapidly. In extremely dense populations, coalescence is dominated by rare fluctuations ahead of the front. However, we show that for moderate densities, a simple quasi-deterministic approximation applies: the rate of coalescence within the front is λ ∼ 2 g ( η ) / ( ρ ℓ ) , where ρ is the population density and ℓ = σ 2 / s is the characteristic scale of the wavefront; g ( η ) depends only on the strength of random drift, η = ρ σ s / 2 . The net effect of a sweep on coalescence also depends crucially on whether two lineages are ever both within the wavefront at the same time: even in the extreme case when coalescence within the front is instantaneous, the net rate of coalescence may be lower than in a single panmictic population. Sweeps can also have a substantial impact on the rate of gene flow. A single lineage will jump to a new location when it is hit by a sweep, with mean square displacement σ eff 2 / σ 2 = ( 8 / 3 ) ( L / ℓ ) ( Λ / R ) ; this can be substantial if the species’ range, L , is large, even if the species-wide rate of sweeps per map length, Λ / R , is small. This effect is half as strong in two dimensions. In contrast, the rate of coalescence between lineages, at random locations in space and on the genetic map, is proportional to ( c / L ) ( Λ / R ) , where c is the wavespeed: thus, on average, one-dimensional structure is likely to reduce coalescence due to sweeps, relative to panmixis. In two dimensions, genes must move along the front before they can coalesce; this process is rapid, being dominated by rare fluctuations. This leads to a dramatically higher rate of coalescence within the wavefront than if lineages simply diffused along the front. Nevertheless, the net rate of coalescence due to a sweep through a two-dimensional population is likely to be lower than it would be with panmixis.},

@article{nullmeier2012coalescent,
  abstract = {Habitat ranges of most species shift over time, for instance due to climate change, human intervention, or adaptation. These demographic changes often have drastic population genetic effects, such as a stochastic resampling of the gene pool through the “surfing” phenomenon. Most models assume that the speed of range expansions is only limited by the dispersal ability of the colonizing species and its reproductive potential. While such models of “phenotype-limited” expansions apply to species invasions, it is clear that many range expansions are limited rather by the slow motion of habitat boundaries, as driven for instance by global warming. Here, we develop a coalescent model to study the genetic impact of such “boundary-limited” range expansions. Our simulations and analysis show that the resulting loss of genetic diversity is markedly lower than in species invasions if large carrying capacities can be maintained up to the habitat frontier. Counterintuitively, we find that the total loss of diversity does not depend on the speed of the range expansion: Slower expansions have a smaller rate of loss, but also last longer. Boundary-limited range expansions exhibit a characteristic genetic footprint and should therefore be distinguished from range expansions limited only by intrinsic characteristics of the species.},

@article{slatkin1991inbreeding,
  abstract = {This paper describes the relationship between probabilities of identity by descent and the distribution of coalescence times. By using the relationship between coalescence times and identity probabilities, it is possible to extend existing results for inbreeding coefficients in regular systems of mating to find the distribution of coalescence times and the mean coalescence times. It is also possible to express Sewall Wright's FST as the ratio of average coalescence times of different pairs of genes. That simplifies the analysis of models of subdivided populations because the average coalescence time can be found by computing separately the time it takes for two genes to enter a single subpopulation and time it takes for two genes in the same subpopulation to coalesce. The first time depends only on the migration matrix and the second time depends only on the total number of individuals in the population. This approach is used to find FST in the finite island model and in one- and two-dimensional stepping-stone models. It is also used to find the rate of approach of FST to its equilibrium value. These results are discussed in terms of different measures of genetic distance. It is proposed that, for the purposes of describing the amount of gene flow among local populations, the effective migration rate between pairs of local populations, M, which is the migration rate that would be estimated for those two populations if they were actually in an island model, provides a simple and useful measure of genetic similarity that can be defined for either allozyme or DNA sequence data.},

Using a technique of Evans (1997), we prove existence and uniqueness in law for the model. We then investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the genealogy of a finite number of individuals sampled uniformly at random (or more generally `far enough apart') from a two-dimensional torus of sidelength L as L tends to infinity. Under appropriate conditions (and on a suitable timescale) we can obtain as limiting genealogical processes a Kingman coalescent, a more general Lambda-coalescent or a system of coalescing Brownian motions (with a non-local coalescence mechanism).

  abstract = { Classical models of gene flow fail in three ways: they cannot explain large-scale patterns; they predict much more genetic diversity than is observed; and they assume that loosely linked genetic loci evolve independently. We propose a new model that deals with these problems. Extinction events kill some fraction of individuals in a region. These are replaced by offspring from a small number of parents, drawn from the preexisting population. This model of evolution forwards in time corresponds to a backwards model, in which ancestral lineages jump to a new location if they are hit by an event, and may coalesce with other lineages that are hit by the same event. We derive an expression for the identity in allelic state, and show that, over scales much larger than the largest event, this converges to the classical value derived by Wright and Malécot. However, rare events that cover large areas cause low genetic diversity, large-scale patterns, and correlations in ancestry between unlinked loci.

only rarely represent first steps toward speciation in the sense of the splitting 
of the species, they are important for the evolution of the species as a whole. 
They provide a possible basis for intergroup selection of genetic systems, a 
process that provides a more effective mechanism for adaptive advance of the 
species as a whole than does the mass selection which is all that can occur 
under panmixia.

1943a). The conclusions have been applied to the interpretation of observed 
local variability in a population of a plant, Linanthus Parryi (WRIGHT 1943b) 
and in one of an animal, Drosophila pseudoobscura (DOBZHANSKY and WRIGHT

pletely random union of gametes within each neighborhood and thus would 
rarely be strictly applicable to actual cases. The purposes of the present paper 
are to compare the effects of various systems of mating within continuous pop- 
ulations, and to present a more accurate method than before for estimating 
from data an important theoretical quantity, N, the effective size of popula- 
tion of a “neighborhood” in the sense discussed below.

@article{barton1995genealogies,
  abstract = {Any sample of genes traces back to a single common ancestor. Each gene also has other properties: its sequence, its geographic location and the phenotype and fitness of the organism that carries it. With sexual reproduction, different genes have different gencalogies, which gives us much more information, but also greatly complicates population genetic analysis. We review the close relation between the distribution of genealogies and the classic theory of identity by descent in spatially structured populations, and develop a simple diffusion approximation to the distribution of coalescence times in a homogeneous two-dimensional habitat. This shows that when neighbourhood size is large (as in most populations) only a small fraction of pairs of genes are closely related, and only this fraction gives information about current rates of gene flow. The increase of spatial dispersion with lineage age is thus a poor estimator of gene flow. The bulk of the genealogy depends on the long-term history of the population; we discuss ways of inferring this history from the concordance between genealogies across loci.

@article{BryanK._Epperson06011999,
  abstract = {Population genetics theory has dealt only with the spatial or geographic pattern of degrees of relatedness or genetic similarity separately for each point in time. However, a frequent goal of experimental studies is to infer migration patterns that occurred in the past or over extended periods of time. To fully understand how a present geographic pattern of genetic variation reflects one in the past, it is necessary to build genealogy models that directly relate the two. For the first time, space-time probabilities of identity by descent and coalescence probabilities are formulated and characterized in this article. Formulations for general migration processes are developed and applied to specific types of systems. The results can be used to determine the level of certainty that genes found in present populations are descended from ancient genes in the same population or nearby populations vs. geographically distant populations. Some parameter combinations result in past populations that are quite distant geographically being essentially as likely to contain ancestors of genes at a given population as the past population located at the same place. This has implications for the geographic point of origin of ancestral, "Eve," genes. The results also form the first model for emerging "space-time" molecular genetic data.

  abstract = {We introduce a general recursion for the probability of identity in state of two individuals sampled from a population subject to mutation, migration, and random drift in a two-dimensional continuum. The recursion allows for the interactions induced by density-dependent regulation of the population, which are inevitable in a continuous population. We give explicit series expansions for large neighbourhood size and for low mutation rates respectively and investigate the accuracy of the classical Malécot formula for these general models. When neighbourhood size is small, this formula does not give the identity even over large scales. However, for large neighbourhood size, it is an accurate approximation which summarises the local population structure in terms of three quantities: the effective dispersal rate, σe; the effective population density, ρe; and a local scale, κ, at which local interactions become significant. The results are illustrated by simulations.

@article{wilkins2004separationoftimescales,
  abstract = {This article presents an analysis of a model of isolation by distance in a continuous, two-dimensional habitat. An approximate expression is derived for the distribution of coalescence times for a pair of sequences sampled from specific locations in a rectangular habitat. Results are qualitatively similar to previous analyses of isolation by distance, but account explicitly for the location of samples relative to the habitat boundaries. A separation-of-timescales approach takes advantage of the fact that the sampling locations affect only the recent coalescent behavior. When the population size is larger than the number of generations required for a lineage to cross the habitat range, the long-term genealogical process is reasonably well described by Kingman's coalescent with time rescaled by the effective population size. This long-term effective population size is affected by the local dispersal behavior as well as the geometry of the habitat. When the population size is smaller than the time required to cross the habitat, deep branches in the genealogy are longer than would be expected under the standard neutral coalescent, similar to the pattern expected for a panmictic population whose population size was larger in the past.

@article{matsen2006convergence,
  abstract = {In this article we apply some graph-theoretic results to the study of coalescence in a structured population with migration. The graph is the pattern of migration among subpopulations, or demes, and we use the theory of random walks on graphs to characterize the ease with which ancestral lineages can traverse the habitat in a series of migration events. We identify conditions under which the coalescent process in populations with restricted migration, such that individuals cannot traverse the habitat freely in a single migration event, nonetheless becomes identical to the coalescent process in the island migration model in the limit as the number of demes tends to infinity. Specifically, we first note that a sequence of symmetric graphs with Diaconis-Stroock constant bounded above has an unstructured Kingman-type coalescent in the limit for a sample of size two from two different demes. We then show that circular and toroidal models with long-range but restricted migration have an upper bound on this constant and so have an unstructured-migration coalescent in the limit. We investigate the rate of convergence to this limit using simulations.

@article{greven2004representation,
  abstract = {We consider spatially interacting Moran models and their diffusion limit which are interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions. The Moran model is a spatial population model with individuals of different type located on sites given by elements of an Abelian group. The dynamics of the system consists of independent migration of individuals between the sites and a resampling mechanism at each site, i.e., pairs of individuals are replaced by new pairs where each newcomer takes the type of a randomly chosen individual from the parent pair. Interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions collect the relative frequency of a subset of types evaluated for the separate sites in the limit of infinitely many individuals per site. One is interested in the type configuration as well as the time-space evolution of genealogies, encoded in the so-called historical process. The first goal of the paper is the analytical characterization of the historical processes for both models as solutions of well-posed martingale problems and the development of a corresponding duality theory.  For that purpose, we link both the historical Fisher-Wright diffusions and the historical Moran models by the so-called look-down process. That is, for any fixed time, a collection of historical Moran models with increasing particle intensity and a particle representation for the limiting historical interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions are provided on one and the same probability space. This leads to a strong form of duality between spatially interacting Moran models, interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions on the one hand and coalescing random walks on the other hand, which extends the classical weak form of moment duality for interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions.  Our second goal is to show that this representation can be used to obtain new results on the long-time behavior,  in particular (i) on the structure of the equilibria, and of the equilibrium historical processes, and (ii) on the behavior of our  models on large but finite site space in comparison with our models on infinite site space. Here the so-called finite system scheme is established for spatially interacting Moran models which implies via the look-down representation also the already known results for interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions. Furthermore suitable versions of the finite system scheme on the level of historical processes are newly developed and verified.  In the long run the provided look-down representation is intended to answer questions about finer path properties of interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions.},

  abstract = {Large-scale genomic data offers the perspective to decipher the genetic
architecture of natural selection. To characterize natural selection, various
analytical methods for detecting candidate genomic regions have been developed.
We propose to perform genome-wide scans of natural selection using principal
component analysis. We show that the common Fst index of genetic
differentiation between populations can be viewed as a proportion of variance
explained by the principal components. Looking at the correlations between
genetic variants and each principal component provides a conceptual framework
to detect genetic variants involved in local adaptation without any prior
definition of populations. To validate the PCA-based approach, we consider the
1000 Genomes data (phase 1) after removal of recently admixed individuals
resulting in 850 individuals coming from Africa, Asia, and Europe. The number
of genetic variants is of the order of 36 millions obtained with a low-coverage
sequencing depth (3X). The correlations between genetic variation and each
principal component provide well-known targets for positive selection (EDAR,
SLC24A5, SLC45A2, DARC), and also new candidate genes (APPBPP2, TP1A1, RTTN,
KCNMA, MYO5C) and non-coding RNAs. In addition to identifying genes involved in
biological adaptation, we identify two biological pathways involved in
polygenic adaptation that are related to the innate immune system (beta
defensins) and to lipid metabolism (fatty acid omega oxidation). PCA-based
statistics retrieve well-known signals of human adaptation, which is
encouraging for future whole-genome sequencing project, especially in non-model
species for which defining populations can be difficult. Genome scan based on
PCA is implemented in the open-source and freely available PCAdapt software.},

Proximally, masting is often correlated with environmental factors and most likely involves differential pollination success and resource allocation, but little is known about how these factors interact or how they influence seed production. We studied masting in the valley oak (Quercus lobata Née), a California endemic tree, and report evidence that phenological synchrony in flowering driven by microclimatic variability determines the size of the acorn crop through its effects on pollen availability and fertilization success. These findings integrate two of the major factors believed to influence seed production in wind-pollinated species?environmental conditions and pollen limitation?by means of a coherent mechanistic hypothesis for how highly variable and synchronized annual seed production is accomplished. We illustrate how, by means of a simulation based on the mechanism proposed here, climate change may influence masting patterns through its effects on environmental variability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Sexual reproduction has classically been considered as a barrier to the buildup of discrete phenotypic differentiation. This notion has been confirmed by models of sympatric speciation in which a fixed genetic architecture and a linear genotype phenotype mapping were assumed. In this paper we study the influence of a flexible genetic architecture and non-linear genotype phenotype map on differentiation under sexual reproduction.We use an individual based model in which organisms have a genome containing genes and transcription factor binding sites. Mutations involve single genes or binding sites or stretches of genome. The genome codes for a regulatory network that determines the gene expression pattern and hence the phenotype of the organism, resulting in a non-linear genotype phenotype map. The organisms compete in a multi-niche environment, imposing selection for phenotypic differentiation.RESULTS:We find as a generic outcome the evolution of discrete clusters of organisms adapted to different niches, despite random mating. Organisms from different clusters are distinct on the genotypic, the network and the phenotypic level. However, the genome and network differences are constrained to a subset of the genome locations, a process we call genotypic canalization. We demonstrate how this canalization leads to an increased robustness to recombination and increasing hybrid fitness. Finally, in case of assortative mating, we explain how this canalization increases the effectiveness of assortativeness.CONCLUSION:We conclude that in case of a flexible genetic architecture and a non-linear genotype phenotype mapping, sexual reproduction does not constrain phenotypic differentiation, but instead constrains the genotypic differences underlying it. We hypothesize that, as genotypic canalization enables differentiation despite random mating and increases the effectiveness of assortative mating, sympatric speciation is more likely than is commonly suggested.},

@article{bradburd2015spatial,
  abstract = {Geographic patterns of genetic variation within modern populations, produced by complex histories of migration, can be difficult to infer and visually summarize. A general consequence of geographically limited dispersal is that samples from nearby locations tend to be more closely related than samples from distant locations, and so genetic covariance often recapitulates geographic proximity. We use genome-wide polymorphism data to build “geogenetic maps”, which, when applied to stationary populations, produces a map of the geographic positions of the populations, but with distances distorted to reflect historical rates of gene flow. In the underlying model, allele frequency covariance is a decreasing function of geogenetic distance, and nonlocal gene flow such as admixture can be identified as anomalously strong covariance over long distances. This admixture is explicitly co-estimated and depicted as arrows, from the source of admixture to the recipient, on the geogenetic map. We demonstrate the utility of this method on a circum-Tibetan sampling of the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides), in which we find evidence for gene flow between the adjacent, terminal populations of the ring species. We also analyze a global sampling of human populations, for which we largely recover the geography of the sampling, with support for significant histories of admixture in many samples. This new tool for understanding and visualizing patterns of population structure is implemented in a Bayesian framework in the program SpaceMix.},

@article{ralph2014convergent,
  abstract = {Species often encounter, and adapt to, many patches of locally similar environmental conditions across their range. Such adaptation can occur through convergent evolution if different alleles arise and spread in different patches, or through the spread of shared alleles by migration acting to synchronize adaptation across the species. The tension between the two reflects the degree of constraint imposed on evolution by the underlying genetic architecture versus how effectively selection and geographic isolation act to inhibit the geographic spread of locally adapted alleles. This paper studies a model of the balance between these two routes to adaptation in continuous environments with patchy selection pressures. We address the following questions: How long does it take for a novel, locally adapted allele to appear in a patch of habitat where it is favored through mutation? Or, through migration from another, already adapted patch? Which is more likely to occur, as a function of distance between the patches? How can we tell which has occurred, i.e. what population genetic signal is left by the spread of migrant alleles? To answer these questions we examine the family structure underlying migration--selection equilibrium surrounding an already adapted patch, in particular treating those rare families that reach new patches as spatial branching processes. This provides a way to understand the role of geographic separation between patches in promoting convergent adaptation and the genomic signals it leaves behind. We illustrate these ideas using the convergent evolution of cryptic coloration in the rock pocket mouse, Chaetodipus intermedius, as an empirical example.},

@article{ralph2014standing,
  abstract = {The extent to which populations experiencing shared selective pressures adapt through a shared genetic response is relevant to many questions in evolutionary biology. In a number of well studied traits and species,  it appears that convergent evolution within species is common. In this paper, we explore how standing, deleterious genetic variation contributes to convergent genetic responses in a geographically spread population, extending our previous work on the topic.
Geographically limited dispersal slows the spread of each selected allele, hence allowing other alleles -- newly arisen mutants or present as standing variation -- 
to spread before any one comes to dominate the population. When such alleles meet, their progress is substantially slowed -- if the alleles are selectively equivalent, they mix slowly, dividing the species range into a random tessellation,
which can be well understood by analogy to a Poisson process model of crystallization. In this framework, we derive the geographic scale over which a typical allele is expected to dominate, the time it takes the species to adapt as a whole, and the proportion of adaptive alleles that arise from standing variation.
Finally, we explore how negative pleiotropic effects of alleles before an environment change can bias the subset of alleles that get to contribute to a species adaptive response. We apply the results to the many geographically localized G6PD deficiency alleles thought to confer resistance to malaria, whose large mutational target size and deleterious effects make them likely candidates to have been present as deleterious standing variation. We find the numbers and geographic spread of these alleles matches our predictions reasonably well, which suggest that these arose both from standing variation and new mutations since the advent of malaria. Our results suggest that much of adaptation may be geographically local even when selection pressures are wide-spread. We close by discussing the implications of these results for arguments of species coherence and the nature of divergence between species.},

@article{kim2011hitchhiking,
  abstract = {A central problem in population genetics is to detect and analyze positive natural selection by which beneficial mutations are driven to fixation. The hitchhiking effect of a rapidly spreading beneficial mutation, which results in local removal of standing genetic variation, allows such an analysis using DNA sequence polymorphism. However, the current mathematical theory that predicts the pattern of genetic hitchhiking relies on the assumption that a beneficial mutation increases to a high frequency in a single random-mating population, which is certainly violated in reality. Individuals in natural populations are distributed over a geographic space. The spread of a beneficial allele can be delayed by limited migration of individuals over the space and its hitchhiking effect can also be affected. To study this effect of geographic structure on genetic hitchhiking, we analyze a simple model of directional selection in a subdivided population. In contrast to previous studies on hitchhiking in subdivided populations, we mainly investigate the range of sufficiently high migration rates that would homogenize genetic variation at neutral loci. We provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations. This raises a possibility of detecting a "hidden" geographic structure of population by carefully analyzing the pattern of a selective sweep.},

@article{barton2000genetic,
  abstract = {Selection on one or more genes inevitably perturbs other genes, even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness. This article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking, concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 + E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be sufficiently frequent to increase significantly the drift of neutral alleles.},

We show that analytically at a certain critical value a diffusion driven (Turing type) instability occurs, i.e. the stationary solution stays stable with respect to the kinetic system (the system without diffusion). We also show that the stationary solution becomes unstable with respect to the system with diffusion and that Turing bifurcation takes place: a spatially non-homogenous (non-constant) solution (structure or pattern) arises. A numerical scheme that preserve the positivity of the numerical solutions and the boundedness of prey solution will be presented. Numerical examples are also included. },

@article{shafer2013widespread,
  abstract = {Ecologically mediated selection has increasingly become recognised as an important driver of speciation. The correlation between neutral genetic differentiation and environmental or phenotypic divergence among populations, to which we collectively refer to as isolation-by-ecology (IBE), is an indicator of ecological speciation. In a meta-analysis framework, we determined the strength and commonality of IBE in nature. On the basis of 106 studies, we calculated a mean effect size of IBE with and without controlling for spatial autocorrelation among populations. Effect sizes were 0.34 (95\% CI 0.24-0.42) and 0.26 (95\% CI 0.13-0.37), respectively, indicating that an average of 5\% of the neutral genetic differentiation among populations was explained purely by ecological contrast. Importantly, spatial autocorrelation reduced IBE correlations for environmental variables, but not for phenotypes. Through simulation, we showed how the influence of isolation-by-distance and spatial autocorrelation of ecological variables can result in false positives or underestimated correlations if not accounted for in the IBE model. Collectively, this meta-analysis showed that ecologically induced genetic divergence is pervasive across time-scales and taxa, and largely independent of the choice of molecular marker. We discuss the importance of these results in the context of adaptation and ecological speciation and suggest future research avenues.

@article{bolnick2013magnitude,
  abstract = {Dispersal moves individuals from patches where their immediate ancestors were successful to sites where their genotypes are untested. As a result, dispersal generally reduces fitness, a phenomenon known as "migration load." The strength of migration load depends on the pattern of dispersal and can be dramatically lessened or reversed when individuals move preferentially toward patches conferring higher fitness. Evolutionary ecologists have long modeled nonrandom dispersal, focusing primarily on its effects on population density over space, the maintenance of genetic variation, and reproductive isolation. Here, we build upon previous work by calculating how the extent of local adaptation and the migration load are affected when individuals differ in their dispersal rate in a genotype-dependent manner that alters their match to their environment. Examining a one-locus, two-patch model, we show that local adaptation occurs through a combination of natural selection and adaptive dispersal. For a substantial portion of parameter space, adaptive dispersal can be the predominant force generating local adaptation. Furthermore, genetic load may be largely averted with adaptive dispersal whenever individuals move before selective deaths occur. Thus, to understand the mechanisms driving local adaptation, biologists must account for the extent and nature of nonrandom, genotype-dependent dispersal, and the potential for adaptation via spatial sorting of genotypes.},

We show that under a branching process approximation, this loss in diversity is due to the difference in offspring variance between individuals at and away from the expansion front, which allows us to measure the strength of the founder effect, dependant on an effective founder size. We demonstrate that the predictions from the branching process model fit very well with Wright-Fisher forward simulations and backwards simulations under a modified Kingman coalescent, and further show that estimates of the effective founder size are robust to possibly confounding factors such as migration between subpopulations. We apply our method to a data set of Arabidopsis thaliana, where we find that the founder effect is about three times stronger in the Americas than in Europe, which may be attributed to the more recent, faster expansion.},

  abstract = {Plant diseases often cause serious yield losses in agriculture. A pathogen's
reproductive fitness can be quantified by the basic reproductive number, R0.
Since pathogen transmission between host plants depends on the spatial
separation between them, R0 is strongly influenced by the spatial scales of
pathogen dispersal and the spatial scales of the host population. The basic
reproductive number was found to increase with the field size at small field
sizes and to saturate to a constant value at large field sizes. It reaches a
maximum in quadratic fields and decreases as the field becomes elongated. This
pattern appears to be quite general: it holds for dispersal kernels that
decrease exponentially or faster as well as for "fat-tailed" dispersal kernels
that decrease slower than exponential (i.e. power-law kernels). We used this
approach to estimate R0 in wheat stripe rust (an important pathogen caused by
Puccinia striiformis), since disease gradients for this pathogen were
thoroughly measured over large distances [Sackett and Mundt, Phytopathology,
95, 983 (2005)]. For the two largest datasets, we estimated R0 in the limit of
large fields to be of the order of 50. These estimates are consistent with
independent field observations [Cowger et al. (2005), Phytopathology, 95,
97282; Farber et al. (2013), Phytopathology, 103, 41]. We present a proof of
principle of a novel approach to estimate the basic reproductive number, R0, of
plant pathogens using wheat stripe rust as a case study. We found that the
spatial extent over which R0 changes strongly is quite fine-scaled (about 30 m
of the linear extension of the field). Our results indicate that in order to
optimize the spatial scale of deployment of fungicides or host resistances, the
adjustments should be made at a fine spatial scale.},

@article{karlin1982classifications,
  abstract = {The idea that levels and forms of genetic variability can be related
to temporal and spatial patterns of environmental heterogeneity is a
widely promulgated theme in evolutionary biology. Recent reviews per-
taining to genetic polymorphisms under conditions of variable selection
and migration are given by Hedrick et at (1976) and Felsenstein (1976) ,
which include numerous references to experimental. field, and theoretical
studies.
ies.
Three classes of migration patterns have been predominantly studied
in theoretical population genetics:
a. The island model (Wright, 1943) consists of an array of islands
exchanging genes uniformly. Equivalently, the island model involves N
"equidistant" islands thai share a common migrant pool drawn equally
from all demes.
The Levene population subdivision structure (1953) is a direct gen·
eralization of Wright's model that allows for variable deme (island) sizes.
Deakin (1966) introduced a homing or sessile tendency so that some
individuals would remain in their deme of birth rather than enter the
migrant pool. He assumed that a fixed proportion of the population is
sessile while the remainder of the population acts according to the Levene
model.
b. The stepping-stone model and. more generaJly. isolation-by-dis-
lance migration patterns assume that the rates of migration between
demes depend on the distances between them. Isolation by distance based
on a o ne, two, or even higher dimensional layout (strata defined by phys-
ical position, social or behavioral characteristics) of the population has
been investigated by Maleeo! (1948, 195 1. 1959, 1967), Jain and Bradshaw
(1966), Kimura and Weiss (1964) , Maruyama (1970), among others. This
class of models generall y involves no differential selection within or be-
tween locaJities. In the context of environmental selection gradients. some
cline stepping-stone models have been extensively investigated (e.g., Slat-
kin , 1973; Nagylaki, 1974. 1975, 1976b, 1978, 1979; Nagylaki and Lucier,
1980; F leming, 1975; Karlin and Richter-Dyn, 1976).
c. Migration matrix models are designed to deal with general migra-
tion patterns (e.g., Malecot, 195 1, 1959; Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza. 1968;
Carmelli and Cavalli-Sforza. 1976; Smith , 1969). Most authors have lim-
ited their attention to linear pressures. i.e ., mutation andlor migration
from an external fixed population, but having no mating or natural se-
lection differences operating.
In both classes of migration structures (b) and (c), computations have
been mainly directed to evaluating the correlation of gene freque ncies
over space and the changes of these with time.
T his work is part of a continuing series of theoretical studies that
seek to understand the effects of different types of spatially and temporally
varying selection regimes coupled with migration patterns on the exist-
ence and nature of polymorphism (Karlin, 1976. 1977a, b ; Karlin and
Richter-Dyn, 1976; Karlin and Campbell . 1978. 1979, 1980). In this chapter
we establish the conditions for the existence of a protected polymorphism
(protection means that none of the alleles become extinct even when
initiall y rare) for a hierarchy of migration patterns. These results will
permit qualitative comparisons of the influence of different structures of
migration exc hange in contributing to the maintenance of polymorph isms.
In this review we describe a series of hybrid migration structures
composed from canonical, e.g .• Levene. Deakin . stepping-stone. circu-
lant migration patterns that entail one or several clusters of demes. Deme
clusters can reflect the background terrain. geographical relationships ,
geological. climatic. or other ecological and environmental factors. and
also behavioral, social, or exogenous genetic-environmental character-
istics . Moreover. by introducing suitable fict itious deme arrays we can simulate the effects of seasonal variation in selection by a spatial selection
gradient. T he seasons often induce cyclic variation.
Some of the models are partly motivated by observations from insect
populations that divide into demes or groups of demes , depending on the
spacing of the plants on which they feed. Natural groupings of demes can
also be associated with arrays of islands, an archipelago. tributaries of
a river, inlets along a coast. a range of hills, spacing of flora. or moun-
tain-valley-canyon topography.
The partitioning of demes into clusters often distinguishes local pop-
ulation interactions against far movements. For example, with respect to
plant dispersal we can contrast t he nearby seed droppings with the long
migrations mediated by vectors (insects, mammals).
A three-tiered clustering of some human populations may arise from
the family-tribe, nation, and race structures. Other criteria for groupings
may relate to social economic status, life-styles, religion and customs.
and educational levels .
Conditions for clustering may be based on aspects ofthe environment
such as degree and kind of salinity. food availability . moistness, exposure,
etc. T he modeling of migration should reflect various levels of clustering
and associated with the clustering is a related pattern of selection.
We will investigate typically the following questions: To what extent
is the maintenance of polymorphism facilitated by the nature of hierar-
chical determinations of deme clustering? What are the consequences
associated with asymmetries in population exchanges? What are the rel-
ative influences of migration rates between and within clusters of demes?
Also, how do we compare spatial versus temporal variations in selection
and migration parameters?
The text is arranged as follow s. The migration patterns on which we
focu s are described in Sections 2-4. In Section 2 we review the formu-
lation of the Levene and Deakin migration models and their extensions
that allow variable (habitat-dependent) rates of homing, several stages of
migration in each life cycle, and different characteristic deme sizes. The
nature of c1inal flow , i.e., migration exchanges per generation limited to
neighboring demes whose rates can vary with respect to positions andlor
differ in reciprocal directions. is described. A number of relevant circulant
migration patterns are set forth. A final class of basic migration forms
involving d irectional migration via a distinguished (major) deme dispers-
ing to or receiving from "subordinate" demes is detailed. The process
of delayed germination in plant species with seed pools can be modeled
by such a migration scheme.
Sections 3 and 4 delineate more-complex migration structures encompassing clusters of several demes each. A population is assumed to
naturally divide into clusters with each cluster consisting of a number of
demes where the migration contrasts refer to intra- and interdeme cluster
movements. For example. a "slar" migration form is developed where
demes along each ray communicate only through a central deme. The
combined effects accruing from temporal and spatial variation can be
studied expeditiously by regarding the aggregate population as consisting
of a multicluster deme formation. Other relevant hybrid migration struc-
tures, such as Kronecker products and generalized circulant migration
systems, are also elaborated. For all these cases we ascertain the con-
ditions for a protected polymorphism and discern their dependence on
the model parameters.
The analytic apparatus used in ascertaining protection for the general
multideme migration-selection model is reviewed at the close of Section
1. Sections 7-10 present conditions for a protected polymorphism ap-
propriate for the models of Sections 2-4.
It is of interest to contrast migration structures as to their degrees
of mixing and isolation. Two such notions were introduced in Karlin
(1976). Several additional concepts and their analyses are set forth in
Section 5. A number of means of comparing selection heterogeneity are
introduced and some robust results interpreted in Section 6. Specifically,
we address the issue of the relationship between spatial or temporal se.
lection " heterogeneity " and the existence of a protected polymorphism.
In Section II we compare the opportunities for protection with mi.
gration once per season versus once per generation for a multideme pop.
ulation subject to seasonal selection variation. The conditions for pro·
tection in a multideme seed pool process are delineated in Section 13. A
number of relations of deme size distributions and allele protection are
de veloped in Section 14. Some models of mUltiple migration stages per
generation are investigated in Section 15. We set forth in Section 16 a
number of result s pertaining to the existence of protection attendant to
the addition or deletion of demes. In this vein. we examine the effects
with respect to protection of the unification or the separation of different
parts ofa population range. It is also of interest to ascertain the similarities
and contrasts in the equilibrium gene frequency patterns that accrue from
an enlarged neutral zone where in other respects the selection migration
structure is unchanged.
The discussion of Section 17 summarizes in qualitative terms some
of the implications and contrasts of the quantitative results of the previous
sections. Mathematical proofs and analyses are relegated to Appendices
A-F. The reader not concerned with the technical developments hence-
forth may best concentrate on Sections 1-4 to understand the spirit of the formulations and motivations on the various migration structures, and
then skip to Section 17 for the qualitative summary and discussion of the
results.},

We found complex hierarchical genetic structure created by altitude, dispersal events, and admixture among subspecies, which complicated identification of locally beneficial alleles.

  abstract = {Ancestry differences corresponding to ethnic groups may be important in determining disease risk factors and optimizing treatment. Our study further defines ancestry relationship among different European ethnic groups by examining over 300 thousand variations in DNA, in over 2,000 individuals. This study allowed a clearer ascertainment of differences that could not be discerned in smaller studies using more limited numbers of DNA variations. We show clear differences among European American participants of different self-identified ethnic affiliation. The analyses showed multiple components of variation. The components showing the largest variations generally corresponded to the grandparental country or region of origin within Europe. We also show the importance of applying this information in determining genetic risk factors for complex diseases. Moreover, the results have enabled a better selection of smaller numbers of DNA variations that can be used in future disease studies to identify more homogenous participant groups and minimize false positive and false negative results in assessing genetic risk factors for disease.},

  abstract = {Understanding the conditions for the stable coexistence of different alleles or species is a central topic in theoretical evolution and ecology. Different causes for stable polymorphism or species coexistence have already been identified but they can be grouped into a limited number of general processes. This article is devoted to the presentation and illustration of a new process, which we call ‘habitat boundary polymorphism’, and which relies on two key ingredients: habitat heterogeneity and distance-limited dispersal. Under direct competition and with fixed population densities, we show that this process allows for the equilibrium coexistence of more than n types in a n-habitat environment. Distance-limited dispersal indeed creates local maladaptation at habitat edges, which leaves room for the invasion of more generalist alleles or species. This mechanism provides a generic yet neglected process for the maintenance of polymorphism or species coexistence.},

@article{savolainen2007local,
  abstract = { Populations are locally adapted when populations have the highest relative fitness at their home sites, and lower fitness in other parts of the range. Results from the extensive experimental plantations of populations of forest trees from different parts of the range show that populations can survive and grow in broad areas outside the home site. However, intra- and interspecific competition limit the distribution of genotypes. For populations from large parts of the range, relative fitness, compared with the local population, is often highest at the home site. At the edges of the range, this local adaptation may break down. The extent of local adaptation is determined by the balance between gene flow and selection. Genetic differentiation and strong natural selection occur over a range of tens or hundreds of kilometers, but reliable measurements of gene flow are available only for much shorter distances. Current models of spatially varying selection could be made more realistic by the incorporation of strong selection and isolation-by-distance characteristic of tree populations. Many studies suggest that most variation in adaptive traits is based on loci with small effects. Association genetics methods and improved genomic resources are useful for the identification of the loci responsible for this variation. The potential for adaptation to current climate change depends on genetic variation and dispersal and establishment rates. },

However, restoration efforts can result in the introduction of novel genes and genotypes into populations when plant materials used are not of local origin. This movement is potentially important because many plant species are subdivided into populations that are adapted to local environmental conditions. Here we focus on genetic concerns arising from ongoing restoration efforts, where often little is known about “How local is local?” (i.e., the geographic or environmental scale over which plant species are adapted). We review the major issues regarding gene flow and local adaptation in the restoration of natural plant populations.

@article{ellison2011population,
  abstract = {Elucidating the connection between genotype, phenotype, and adaptation in wild populations is fundamental to the study of evolutionary biology, yet it remains an elusive goal, particularly for microscopic taxa, which comprise the majority of life. Even for microbes that can be reliably found in the wild, defining the boundaries of their populations and discovering ecologically relevant phenotypes has proved extremely difficult. Here, we have circumvented these issues in the microbial eukaryote Neurospora crassa by using a “reverse-ecology” population genomic approach that is free of a priori assumptions about candidate adaptive alleles. We performed Illumina whole-transcriptome sequencing of 48 individuals to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms. From these data, we discovered two cryptic and recently diverged populations, one in the tropical Caribbean basin and the other endemic to subtropical Louisiana. We conducted high-resolution scans for chromosomal regions of extreme divergence between these populations and found two such genomic “islands.” Through growth-rate assays, we found that the subtropical Louisiana population has a higher fitness at low temperature (10 °C) and that several of the genes within these distinct regions have functions related to the response to cold temperature. These results suggest the divergence islands may be the result of local adaptation to the 9 °C difference in average yearly minimum temperature between these two populations. Remarkably, another of the genes identified using this unbiased, whole-genome approach is the well-known circadian oscillator frequency, suggesting that the 2.4°–10.6° difference in latitude between the populations may be another important environmental parameter.},

@article{becker2006local,
  abstract = {Spatial variation in environmental conditions can lead to local adaptation of plant populations, particularly if gene flow among populations is low. Many studies have investigated adaptation to contrasting environmental conditions, but little is known about the spatial scale of adaptive evolution. We studied population differentiation and local adaptation at two spatial scales in the monocarpic grassland perennial Carlina vulgaris. We reciprocally transplanted seedlings among five European regions (northwestern Czech Republic, central Germany, Luxembourg, southern Sweden and northwestern Switzerland) and among populations of different sizes within three of the regions. We recorded survival, growth and reproduction over three growing periods. At the regional scale, several performance traits and the individual fitness of C. vulgaris were highest if the plants were grown in their home region and they decreased with increasing transplant distance. The effects are likely due to climatic differences that increased with the geographical distance between regions. At the local scale, there were significant interactions between the effects of the population of origin and the transplant site, but these were not due to an enhanced performance of plants at their home site and they were not related to the geographical or environmental distance between the site of origin and the transplant site. The size of the population of origin did not influence the strength of local adaptation. The results of our study suggest that C. vulgaris consists of regionally adapted genotypes, and that distance is a good predictor of the extent of adaptive differentiation at large scales ( > 200 km) but not at small scales. We conclude that patterns of local adaptation should be taken into account for the efficient preservation of genetic resources, when assessing the status of a plant species and during conservation planning.},

  abstract = {We studied five populations of a rainforest
understory insectivorous bird (Myrmeciza exsul, chestnut-
backed antbird) in a fragmented landscape in northeastern
Costa Rica in order to test hypotheses about the influence
of forest fragmentation on population genetic structure
using 16 microsatellite loci. Bayesian assignment approa-
ches—perhaps the most conservative analyses we per-
formed—consistently grouped the sites into two distinct
groups, with all individuals from the smallest and most
isolated population clustering separately from the other
four sites. Additional analyses revealed (1) overall signif-
icant genetic structure; (2) a pattern of population differ-
entiation consistent with a hypothesis of isolation by
resistance (landscape connectivity), but not distance; and
(3) relatively short dispersal distances indicated by ele-
vated mean pairwise relatedness in several of the sites. Our
results are somewhat surprising given the small geographic
distances between sites (11–34 km) and the short time
(*60 years) since wide-spread deforestation in this land-
scape. We suspect fine-scale genetic structure may occur in
many resident tropical bird species, and in the case of the
chestnut-backed antbird it appears that anthropogenic
habitat fragmentation has important population genetic implications. It appears that chestnut-backed antbirds may
persist in fragmented landscapes in the absence of signifi-
cant migration among patches, but mechanisms that allow
this species to persist when many other similar species do
not are not well understood.},

A model that includes these phenomena, as well as geographic subdivision and linkage to a polymorphism maintained either by local adaptation or by balancing selection, is derived, and the expected coalescence time for a pair of genes is calculated. It is found that background selection reduces coalescence times within subpopulations and allelic classes, leading to a high degree of apparent differentiation. Extremely high levels of subpopulation differentiation are also expected for regions of the genome surrounding loci important in local adaptation. These regions will be wider the stronger the local selection, and the higher the selfing rate.},

@article{fisher1950frequencies,
  abstract = {IN 1937 (1) the author studied the distribution of the gene ratio in the
simple case of an advantageous gene advancing along a linear habitat
under a constant selective advantage. In Nature situations must be
more complex than in this simple model; in particular it must often occur
that the selective advantage itself varies with position. The interest-
ing case arises in which a gene enjoys a selective advantage in one part of
a species' range, while in the remainder it is at a selective disadvantage.
On the boundary between these regions selection is neutral between two
allelomorphic genes.
Cases can be observed in practice in which there is a gradient, or
line, in the frequencies of the genotypes determined by a single factor.
Generally such cases will be complicated by inequalities of topography,
and by consequent irregularities in the population density, and in the
gradient of selective advantage. It is to be expected also that the boun-
dary will in general neither be straight (i.e. a great circle of the earth's
surface), nor constant in position under the conditions prevailing in
different years. Any model worth discussing from a theoretical stand-
point will therefore be a drastically simplified one, playing the part of a
basis for comparisons by which the real complexities of each situation
may be critically demonstrated.
The purely genetical complication of non-recognition of genotype,
due to dominance, is also ignored. This is chiefly because I should regard
the occurrence of true dominance in such cases as a danger-signal sug-
gesting the very different genetic situation of a balanced polymorphism;
partly because if on more careful examination it is found that the hetero-
zygote is recognizable this will greatly increase the value of the observa-
tions.
The problem chosen for discussion, as an extension of my work of
1937, thus differs materially from that considered by Haldane in 1948

  abstract = {Estimating dispersal distances from population genetic data provides an important alternative to logistically taxing methods for directly observing dispersal. Although methods for estimating dispersal rates between a modest number of discrete demes are well developed, methods of inference applicable to "isolation-by-distance" models are much less established. Here, we present a method for estimating rhosigma(2), the product of population density (rho) and the variance of the dispersal displacement distribution (sigma(2)). The method is based on the assumption that low-frequency alleles are identical by descent. Hence, the extent of geographic clustering of such alleles, relative to their frequency in the population, provides information about rhosigma(2). We show that a novel likelihood-based method can infer this composite parameter with a modest bias in a lattice model of isolation-by-distance. For calculating the likelihood, we use an importance sampling approach to average over the unobserved intraallelic genealogies, where the intraallelic genealogies are modeled as a pure birth process. The approach also leads to a likelihood-ratio test of isotropy of dispersal, that is, whether dispersal distances on two axes are different. We test the performance of our methods using simulations of new mutations in a lattice model and illustrate its use with a dataset from Arabidopsis thaliana.},

  abstract = {Despite growing interest in the effects of landscape heterogeneity on genetic structuring, few tools are available to incorporate data on landscape composition into population genetic studies. Analyses of isolation by distance have typically either assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation-by-resistance (IBR) model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance, a distance metric that exploits precise relationships between random walk times and effective resistances in electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation, the resistance distance is both more theoretically justified and more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least cost path-based distance measures. Moreover, the metric can be applied with a wide range of data inputs, including coarse-scale range maps, simple maps of habitat and nonhabitat within a species' range, or complex spatial datasets with habitats and barriers of differing qualities. The IBR model thus provides a flexible and efficient tool to account for habitat heterogeneity in studies of isolation by distance, improve understanding of how landscape characteristics affect genetic structuring, and predict genetic and evolutionary consequences of landscape change.},

To further investigate the effect of speciation on neutral biodiversity, we analyze a spatially explicit neutral model based on population genetics. We define the metacommunity as a system of populations exchanging migrants, and we use this framework to introduce speciation with little or no gene flow (allopatric and parapatric speciation). We find that with realistic mutation rates, our metacommunity model driven by neutral processes cannot support more than a few species. Adding natural selection in the population genetics of speciation increases the number of species in the metacommunity, but the level of diversity found in the Barro Colorado Island is difficult to reach.},

@article{slatkin1978spatial,
  abstract = {The spatial patterns in the mean and variance of a quantitative character that result from the interaction of spatially varying, optimizing selection and gene flow are considered. The model analyzed is an extension of those of Kimura (1965) and Lande (1976) for the distribution of a quantitative character maintained in a population by independent mutations. For weak selection, it is shown that there is only a small effect of gene flow on the variance of the character and that the mean value changes on a length scale that is large compared to the average dispersal distance. As in models of clines in allele frequencies, it is possible to define a “characteristic length” in terms of the average dispersal distance and strength of selection. The characteristic length is the smallest length scale environmental change to which the mean value of the character can significantly respond. It is also shown that, for weak selection, an asymmetry in dispersal can result in a significant shift in location of a cline. By considering an infinite linear cline in optimal values, it is shown that gene flow can increase the variance only when there is sufficient mixing in each generation of individuals from locations with different means. A model of selection in different niches is also considered. There is an increase in variance due to the effective weakening of the intensity of selection because of the differences in optimal values in different niches.

The implications of the different models for maintenance of genetic polymorphism are discussed. Under some conditions gene flow can produce a significant increase in heterozygosity. It is also argued that spatial variation in selection on a polygenic character can be much more effective in increasing heterozygosity than temporal variation because of the potentially greater increase in phenotypic variance. The difference between some of the results for polygenic characters from those of similar models of one and two locus systems is accounted for by the fact that for normally distributed polygenic characters, changes in the variance are effectively decoupled from changes in the mean.},

@article{huelsenbeck2007inference,
  abstract = {Inferring population structure from genetic data sampled from some number of individuals is a formidable statistical problem. One widely used approach considers the number of populations to be fixed and calculates the posterior probability of assigning individuals to each population. More recently, the assignment of individuals to populations and the number of populations have both been considered random variables that follow a Dirichlet process prior. We examined the statistical behavior of assignment of individuals to populations under a Dirichlet process prior. First, we examined a best-case scenario, in which all of the assumptions of the Dirichlet process prior were satisfied, by generating data under a Dirichlet process prior. Second, we examined the performance of the method when the genetic data were generated under a population genetics model with symmetric migration between populations. We examined the accuracy of population assignment using a distance on partitions. The method can be quite accurate with a moderate number of loci. As expected, inferences on the number of populations are more accurate when theta = 4N(e)u is large and when the migration rate (4N(e)m) is low. We also examined the sensitivity of inferences of population structure to choice of the parameter of the Dirichlet process model. Although inferences could be sensitive to the choice of the prior on the number of populations, this sensitivity occurred when the number of loci sampled was small; inferences are more robust to the prior on the number of populations when the number of sampled loci is large. Finally, we discuss several methods for summarizing the results of a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of population structure. We develop the notion of the mean population partition, which is the partition of individuals to populations that minimizes the squared partition distance to the partitions sampled by the MCMC algorithm.},

divergence in salmonid populations has been used to describe the pattern of genetic exchange
and degree of isolation among local geographic units. Our goal is to determine how much
genetic exchange among subpopulations will yield observed patterns of allelic divergence.
We approach this goal using population genetics theory and a series of computer simulations.
The amount of allelic divergence between subpopulations is a function of the absolute
number of migrant individuals exchanged, and not the proportion of individuals exchanged.
Therefore, some knowledge of population sizes is needed to estimate degree of reproductive
isolation from allelic frequency data. Second, statistically significant allelic divergence will
often be present even when there is substantialexchange among subpopulations. For example,
significant allelic divergence was present in our simulations over 50\% of the time with 20
subpopulations exchanging 50 individuals per generation. Third, allelic frequencies estimated
from fry should be used with caution when drawing conclusions about the significance of
allelic divergence in the reproducing adults.},

  abstract = {The salamander Ensatina eschscholtzii is a classic example of a ring species, and has an intricate biogeographic history. Within a part of the ring distribution, earlier work using allozymes disclosed high levels of genetic structure in central coastal California, where the subspecies oregonensis, xanthoptica, and eschscholtzii meet. We used mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences to further examine patterns of divergence in this area, including data from 155 localities (309 individuals). Our focus is on the documentation of population-level haplotype lineages. We show that oregonensis is represented by two unrelated, phenotypically similar clades, both of which possess substantial substructure of their own. The subspecies xanthoptica includes two lineages that differ in phenotype, one of which has colonized the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The subspecies eschscholtzii occurs mainly to the south, but some populations from a northern lineage extend into the Monterey Bay region, where they approach xanthoptica geographically. In sum, populations in the central coastal California region form a distributional patchwork, including three subspecies, three clades (which differ from the three subspecies), and ten haplotype lineages. We conclude that such striking levels of phylogeographic structure reflect interspersed episodes of spatial fragmentation, in part driven by the complex geomorphological evolution of the California Coast Range system.},

that spatial structure suppresses conjugation in surface-associated growth

@misc{foll2014hierarchical,
  abstract = {Detecting genes involved in local adaptation is challenging and of
fundamental importance in evolutionary, quantitative, and medical genetics. To
this aim, a standard strategy is to perform genome scans in populations of
different origins and environments, looking for genomic regions of high
differentiation. Because shared population history or population sub-structure
may lead to an excess of false positives, analyses are often done on multiple
pairs of populations, which leads to i) a global loss of power as compared to a
global analysis, and ii) the need for multiple tests corrections. In order to
alleviate these problems, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian method to
detect markers under selection that can deal with complex demographic
histories, where sampled populations share part of their history. Simulations
show that our approach is both more powerful and less prone to false positive
loci than approaches based on separate analyses of pairs of populations or
those ignoring existing complex structures. In addition, our method can
identify selection occurring at different levels (i.e. population or
region-specific adaptation), as well as convergent selection in different
regions. We apply our approach to the analysis of a large SNP dataset from low-
and high-altitude human populations from America and Asia. The simultaneous
analysis of these two geographic areas allows us to identify several new
candidate genome regions for altitudinal selection, and we show that convergent
evolution among continents has been quite common. In addition to identifying
several genes and biological processes involved in high altitude adaptation, we
identify two specific biological pathways that could have evolved in both
continents to counter toxic effects induced by hypoxia.},

The long-term stochastic growth rate lim(t→∞) t⁻¹ log Z(t) for such a population equals μ - σ²/2 . Most populations, however, experience spatial as well as temporal variability. To understand the interactive effects of environmental stochasticity, spatial heterogeneity, and dispersal on population growth, we study an analogous model X(t) = (X¹(t) , . . . , X(n)(t)), t ≥ 0, for the population abundances in n patches: the conditional law of X(t+Δt) given X(t) = x is such that the conditional mean of X(i)(t+Δt) - X(i)(t) is approximately [x(i)μ(i) + Σ(j) (x(j) D(ji) - x(i) D(i j) )]Δt where μ(i) is the per capita growth rate in the ith patch and D(ij) is the dispersal rate from the ith patch to the jth patch, and the conditional covariance of X(i)(t+Δt)- X(i)(t) and X(j)(t+Δt) - X(j)(t) is approximately x(i)x(j)σ(ij)Δt for some covariance matrix Σ = (σ(ij)). We show for such a spatially extended population that if S(t) = X¹(t)+· · ·+ X(n)(t) denotes the total population abundance, then Y(t) = X(t)/S(t), the vector of patch proportions, converges in law to a random vector Y(∞) as t → ∞, and the stochastic growth rate lim(t→∞) t⁻¹ log S(t) equals the space-time average per-capita growth rate Σ(i)μ(i)E[Y(i)(∞)] experienced by the population minus half of the space-time average temporal variation E[Σ(i,j) σ(i j)Y(i)(∞) Y(j)(∞)] experienced by the population. Using this characterization of the stochastic growth rate, we derive an explicit expression for the stochastic growth rate for populations living in two patches, determine which choices of the dispersal matrix D produce the maximal stochastic growth rate for a freely dispersing population, derive an analytic approximation of the stochastic growth rate for dispersal limited populations, and use group theoretic techniques to approximate the stochastic growth rate for populations living in multi-scale landscapes (e.g. insects on plants in meadows on islands). Our results provide fundamental insights into "ideal free" movement in the face of uncertainty, the persistence of coupled sink populations, the evolution of dispersal rates, and the single large or several small (SLOSS) debate in conservation biology. For example, our analysis implies that even in the absence of density-dependent feedbacks, ideal-free dispersers occupy multiple patches in spatially heterogeneous environments provided environmental fluctuations are sufficiently strong and sufficiently weakly correlated across space. In contrast, for diffusively dispersing populations living in similar environments, intermediate dispersal rates maximize their stochastic growth rate.},

Recent progress in studying migratory bird connectivity has been made using genetic and stable-isotope markers to assign migratory individuals to their breeding grounds. Here, we present a novel Bayesian approach to jointly leverage genetic and isotopic markers and we test its utility on two migratory passerine bird species. Our approach represents a principled model-based combination of genetic and isotope data from samples collected on the breeding grounds and is able to achieve levels of assignment accuracy that exceed those of either method alone. When applied at large scale the method can reveal specific migratory connectivity patterns. In Wilson's warblers (Wilsonia pusilla), we detect a subgroup of birds wintering in Baja that uniquely migrate preferentially from the coastal Pacific Northwest. Our approach is implemented in a way that is easily extended to accommodate additional sources of information (e.g. bi-allelic markers, species distribution models, etc.) or adapted to other species or assignment problems.},

Scale serves as an abstract concept, providing a framework for organizing observations and theoretical models, and plays a functional role in the organization of ecological communities and physical processes. Rich methodological resources are available to plant pathologists interested in considering either or both aspects of scale in their research. We summarize important concepts in both areas of the literature, particularly as they apply to the spatial pattern of plant disease, and highlight some new results that emphasize the importance of scaling on the emergence of different types of probability distribution in empirical observation. We also highlight the important links between heterogeneity and scale, which are of central importance in plant disease epidemiology and the analysis of spatial pattern. We consider statistical approaches that are available, where actual physical scale is known, and for more conceptual research on hierarchies, where scale plays a more abstract role, particularly for field-based research. For the latter, we highlight methods that plant pathologists could consider to account for the effect of scale in the design of field studies. },

Empirical studies often seek to investigate the relationship between genetic differentiation and some ecological variable(s) while accounting for geographic distance, but common approaches to this problem (such as the partial Mantel test) have a number of drawbacks. In this article, we present a Bayesian method that enables users to quantify the relative contributions of geographic distance and ecological distance to genetic differentiation between sampled populations or individuals. We model the allele frequencies in a set of populations at a set of unlinked loci as spatially correlated Gaussian processes, in which the covariance structure is a decreasing function of both geographic and ecological distance. Parameters of the model are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We call this method Bayesian Estimation of Differentiation in Alleles by Spatial Structure and Local Ecology (BEDASSLE), and have implemented it in a user-friendly format in the statistical platform R. We demonstrate its utility with a simulation study and empirical applications to human and teosinte data sets.},

Characterized by locally correlated allele frequencies, these patterns are known to create periodic shapes in geographic maps of principal components which confound signatures of specific migration events and influence interpretations of principal component analyses (PCA). In this study, we introduced models combining probabilistic PCA and kriging models to infer population genetic structure from genetic data while correcting for effects generated by spatial autocorrelation. The corresponding algorithms are based on singular value decomposition and low rank approximation of the genotypic data. As their complexity is close to that of PCA, these algorithms scale with the dimension of the data. To illustrate the utility of these new models, we simulated isolation-by-distance patterns and broad-scale geographic variation using spatial coalescent models. Our methods remove the horseshoe patterns usually observed in PC maps and simplify intrepretations of spatial genetic variation.

  abstract = {Abstract Source–sink systems are metapopulations of patches with different, and possibly temporally varying, habitat qualities, which are commonly used in ecology to study the fate of spatially extended populations. We propose new techniques that disentangle the respective contributions of demography and dispersal to the dynamics and fate of a single species in a source–sink system. Our approach is valid for a general class of stochastic, individual-based, stepping-stone models, with density-independent demography and dispersal, provided that the metapopulation is finite or else enjoys some transitivity property. We provide (1) a simple criterion of persistence, by studying the motion of a single random disperser until it returns to its initial position; (2) a joint characterization of the long-term growth rate and of the asymptotic occupancy frequencies of the ancestral lineage of a random survivor, by using large deviations theory. Both techniques yield formulas decoupling demography and dispersal, and can be adapted to the case of periodic or random environments, where habitat qualities are autocorrelated in space and possibly in time. In this last case, we display examples of coupled time-averaged sinks allowing survival, as was previously known in the absence of demographic stochasticity for fully mixing (Jansen and Yoshimura, 1998) or partially mixing (Evans et al., 2012; Schreiber, 2010) metapopulations. },

Local adaptation is often inferred from the detection of loci showing a high differentiation between populations, the so-called FST outliers. Methods of detection of loci under selection are reputed to be robust in most spatial population models. However, using simulations we showed that FST outlier tests provided a high rate of false-positives (up to 60%) in fractal environments such as river networks. Surprisingly, the number of sampled demes was correlated with parameters of population genetic structure, such as the variance of FSTs, and hence strongly influenced the rate of outliers. This unappreciated property of river networks therefore needs to be accounted for in genetic studies on adaptation and conservation of river organisms.},

@article{bierne2013pervasive,
  abstract = {It is now common for population geneticists to estimate FST for a large number of loci across the genome, before testing for selected loci as being outliers to the FST distribution. One surprising result of such FST scans is the often high proportion (>1\% and sometimes >10\%) of outliers detected, and this is often interpreted as evidence for pervasive local adaptation. In this issue of Molecular Ecolog, Fourcade et al. () observe that a particularly high rate of FST outliers has often been found in river organisms, such as fishes or damselflies, despite there being no obvious reason why selection should affect a larger proportion of the genomes of these organisms. Using computer simulations, Fourcade et al. () show that the strong correlation in co-ancestry produced in long one-dimensional landscapes (such as rivers, valleys, peninsulas, oceanic ridges or coastlines) greatly increases the neutral variance in FST, especially when the landscape is further reticulated into fractal networks. As a consequence, outlier tests have a high rate of false positives, unless this correlation can be taken into account. Fourcade et al.'s study highlights an extreme case of the general problem, first noticed by Robertson (,b) and Nei & Maruyama (), that correlated co-ancestry inflates the neutral variance in FST when compared to its expectation under an island model of population structure. Similar warnings about the validity of outlier tests have appeared regularly since then but have not been widely cited in the recent genomics literature. We further emphasize that FST outliers can arise in many different ways and that outlier tests are not designed for situations where the genetic architecture of local adaptation involves many loci.},

Here we test the first part of a hypothesis that all of these patterns may reflect gene flow at small geographic scales. We use amplified fragment length polymorphism variation to quantify the geographic scales of spatial genetic structure and apparent gene flow in Calochortus albus, a widespread member of the genus, at Henry Coe State Park in the Coast Ranges south of San Francisco Bay. Analyses of 254 mapped individuals spaced 0.001–14.4 km apart show a highly significant decline in genetic identity with ln distance, implying a root-mean-square distance of gene flow σ of 5–43 m. STRUCTURE analysis implies the existence of 2–4 clusters over the study area, with frequent reversals among clusters over short distances (<200 m) and a relatively high frequency of admixture within individuals at most sampling sites. While the intensity of spatial genetic structure in C. albus is weak, as measured by the Sp statistic, that appears to reflect low genetic identity of adjacent plants, which might reflect repeated colonizations at small spatial scales or density-dependent mortality of individual genotypes by natural enemies. Small spatial scales of gene flow and spatial genetic structure should permit, under a variety of conditions, genetic differentiation within species at such scales, setting the stage ultimately for speciation and adaptive radiation as such scales as well.},

  abstract = {Individuals within any species exhibit differences in size, developmental
state, or spatial location. These differences coupled with environmental
fluctuations in demographic rates can have subtle effects on population
persistence and species coexistence. To understand these effects, we provide a
general theory for coexistence of structured, interacting species living in a
stochastic environment. The theory is applicable to nonlinear, multi species
matrix models with stochastically varying parameters. The theory relies on
long-term growth rates of species corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov
exponents of random matrix products. Our coexistence criterion requires that a
convex combination of these long-term growth rates is positive with probability
one whenever one or more species are at low density. When this condition holds,
the community is stochastically persistent: the fraction of time that a species
density goes below $\delta>0$ approaches zero as $\delta$ approaches zero.
Applications to predator-prey interactions in an autocorrelated environment, a
stochastic LPA model, and spatial lottery models are provided. These
applications demonstrate that positive autocorrelations in temporal
fluctuations can disrupt predator-prey coexistence, fluctuations in
log-fecundity can facilitate persistence in structured populations, and
long-lived, relatively sedentary competing populations are likely to coexist in
spatially and temporally heterogenous environments.},

  abstract = {Abstract
The rock–paper–scissors game–which is characterized by three strategies R , P , S , satisfying the non-transitive relations S excludes P , P excludes R , and R excludes S –serves as a simple prototype for studying more complex non-transitive systems. For well-mixed systems where interactions result in fitness reductions of the losers exceeding fitness gains of the winners, classical theory predicts that two strategies go extinct. The effects of spatial heterogeneity and dispersal rates on this outcome are analyzed using a general framework for evolutionary games in patchy landscapes. The analysis reveals that coexistence is determined by the rates at which dominant strategies invade a landscape occupied by the subordinate strategy (e.g. rock invades a landscape occupied by scissors) and the rates at which subordinate strategies get excluded in a landscape occupied by the dominant strategy (e.g. scissors gets excluded in a landscape occupied by rock). These invasion and exclusion rates correspond to eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics near single strategy equilibria. Coexistence occurs when the product of the invasion rates exceeds the product of the exclusion rates. Provided there is sufficient spatial variation in payoffs, the analysis identifies a critical dispersal rate d ∗ required for regional persistence. For dispersal rates below d ∗ , the product of the invasion rates exceeds the product of the exclusion rates and the rock–paper–scissors metacommunities persist regionally despite being extinction prone locally. For dispersal rates above d ∗ , the product of the exclusion rates exceeds the product of the invasion rates and the strategies are extinction prone. These results highlight the delicate interplay between spatial heterogeneity and dispersal in mediating long-term outcomes for evolutionary games.},

@article{barton2013inference,
  abstract = {Abstract
We outline two approaches to inference of neighbourhood size, N , and dispersal rate, σ 2 , based on either allele frequencies or on the lengths of sequence blocks that are shared between genomes. Over intermediate timescales (10–100 generations, say), populations that live in two dimensions approach a quasi-equilibrium that is independent of both their local structure and their deeper history. Over such scales, the standardised covariance of allele frequencies (i.e. pairwise F S T ) falls with the logarithm of distance, and depends only on neighbourhood size, N , and a ‘local scale’, κ ; the rate of gene flow, σ 2 , cannot be inferred. We show how spatial correlations can be accounted for, assuming a Gaussian distribution of allele frequencies, giving maximum likelihood estimates of N and κ . Alternatively, inferences can be based on the distribution of the lengths of sequence that are identical between blocks of genomes: long blocks (&gt;0.1 cm, say) tell us about intermediate timescales, over which we assume a quasi-equilibrium. For large neighbourhood size, the distribution of long blocks is given directly by the classical Wright–Malécot formula; this relationship can be used to infer both N and σ 2 . With small neighbourhood size, there is an appreciable chance that recombinant lineages will coalesce back before escaping into the distant past. For this case, we show that if genomes are sampled from some distance apart, then the distribution of lengths of blocks that are identical in state is geometric, with a mean that depends on N and σ 2 .},

@article{sousa2013identifying,
  abstract = {When divergence occurs in the presence of gene flow there can arise an interesting dynamic in which selection against gene flow, at sites associated with population specific adaptations or genetic incompatibilities, can cause net gene flow to vary across the genome. Loci linked to sites under selection may experience reduced gene flow and may experience genetic bottlenecks by the action of nearby selective sweeps. Data from histories such as these may be poorly fit by conventional neutral model approaches to demographic inference which treat all loci as equally subject to forces of genetic drift and gene flow. To allow for demographic inference in the face of such histories, as well as the identification of loci affected by selection, we developed an isolation with migration model that explicitly provides for variation among genomic regions in migration rates and/or rates of genetic drift. The method allows for loci to fall into any of multiple groups, each characterized by a different set of parameters, thus relaxing the assumption that all loci share the same demography. By grouping loci, the method can be applied to data with multiple loci and still have tractable dimensionality and statistical power. We studied the performance of the method using simulated data, and we applied the method to study the divergence of two subspecies of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).},

The growth rate $m(x)$ is positive on favorable habitats and negative on unfavorable ones. The environment $\Omega $ is bounded and surrounded by uninhabitable regions, so that $u = 0$ on $\partial \Omega \times (0,\infty )$. In a previous paper, the authors considered the special case $d(x,u) = d$, a constant, and ${\bf b} = 0$, and were able to make an analysis based on variational methods. The inclusion of density dependent diffusion and/or drift makes for more flexible and realistic models. However, variational methods are mathematically insufficient in these more complicated situations. By employing methods based on monotonicity and positive operator theory, many previous results on the dependence on m of the overall suitability of the environment can be recovered and some new results can be established concerning environmental quality dependence on ${\bf b}$. In the process, a bifurcation and stability analysis is made of the model which includes some new estimates on eigenvalues for associated linear problems.},

If the environment ∞ is bounded and is surrounded by uninhabitable regions, then u = 0 on ∂∞× (0, ∞). The growth rate m(x) is positive on favourablehabitats and negative on unfavourable ones.

Analysis of how S030821050001876X_inline1 depends on m indicates that environments with favourable and unfavourable habitats closely intermingled are worse for the population than those containing large regions of uniformly favourable habitat. In the limit as the diffusion rate d ↓ 0, the solutions tend toward the positive part of m(x)/c, and if m is discontinuous develop interior transition layers. The analysis uses bifurcation and continuation methods, the variational characterisation of eigenvalues, upper and lower solution techniques, and singular perturbation theory.},

We investigate the minimization of the positive principal eigenvalue under the constraint that the weight is bounded by a positive and a negative constant and the total weight is a fixed negative constant. For an arbitrary domain, it is shown that every global minimizer must be of ``bang-bang'' type. When the domain is an interval, it is proved that there are exactly two global minimizers, for which the weight is positive at one end of the interval and is negative in the remainder. The biological implication is that a single favorable region at one end of the habitat provides the best opportunity for the species to survive, and also that the least fragmented habitat provides the best chance for the population to maintain its genetic variability.},

@article{karlin1977frequency,
  abstract = {In the context of a multideme population structure subject to selection, migration, and mating forces, it is desired to ascertain the stable evolutionary outcomes for various classes of selection regimes. These include selection patterns as (i) a mosaic of local directed selection effects, (ii) overdominance throughout with varying intensities of the local heterozygote advantage, (iii) varying degrees of underdominance throughout, (iv) a mixed underdominant-overdominant regime. An accounting of the nature of the equilibrium configurations in the Levene population subdivision model was done with respect to the above classes of selection regimes. In particular, it is established that multiple polymorphic equilibria do not arise for selection structures (i) and (ii), while for the mixed underdominant-overdominant selection form (iv) with appropriate parameter ranges there can exist two stable internal equilibria. A surprising finding is that the number and/or character of the equilibria is not changed by increased population division beyond that of two habitats, while there is a significant difference in the equilibrium possibilities for a one- as against a two-deme population. These results appear to be a special limiting feature of the Levene population subdivision formulation.

Levene's model is: large common mating pool, redistributed to "islands" in varying proportions.},

and the autocorrelation function, A(t) ≡ (-1)n Pn ∼ t-d/2 in arbitrary dimension d. These exact
results are complemented by a mean-field theory, heuristic arguments and numerical simulations. For
dimensions d > 2, the system does not coarsen, and the opinion changes follow a nearly Poissonian
distribution, in agreement with mean-field theory. For dimensions d ≤ 2, the distribution is given
by a different scaling form, which is characterized by nontrivial scaling exponents. For unequal

the majority and the minority, as well as for even and odd n.

  abstract = {Inferring the nature and magnitude of selection is an important problem in many biological contexts. Typically when estimating a selection coefficient for an allele, it is assumed that samples are drawn from a panmictic population and that selection acts uniformly across the population. However these assumptions are rarely satisfied. Natural populations are almost always structured, and selective pressures are likely to act differentially. Inference about selection ought therefore to take account of structure. We do this by considering evolution in a simple lattice model of spatial population structure. We develop a hidden Markov model based maximum likelihood approach for estimating the selection coefficient in a single population from time series data of allele frequencies. We then develop an approximate extension of this to the structured case to provide a joint estimate of migration rate and spatially varying selection coefficients. We illustrate our method using classical datasets of moth pigmentation morph frequencies, but it has wide applications in settings ranging from ecology to human evolution.},

We demonstrate how this overcomes some of the obstructions to modelling populations which evolve in two-(and higher-) dimensional spatial continua, how its predictions match phenomena observed in data and how it fits with classical models. Finally we outline some directions for future research.},

  abstract = {... It has probably occurred to the reader that the coefficientof inbreeding may mean very different
things in different cases. (1) There may be divisionof the population into completely isolated small
strains, within each of which there is random mating. The inbreeding coefficient of individuals
relative to the total is here due merely to the relationship of all members of the same strain and
disappears at once with random mating among strains. (2) There may be fiwquent mating of close
relatives but no permanent separation of strains. Here again random mating at once reduces the
inbreeding coefficient to zero. (3) The sires used may be rather limited in number and derived from
even more limited numbers of grandsires and great-grmdsires. In this cam there may be little
apparent close inbreeding at any time, contrary to (2), and no division into strains, contrary to (l),
but the value of F, relative to the foundation stock, keeps rising and cannot be much reduced by
random mating. There are other possibilities. Clearly we need something more than a single
value of F to give an adequate description of structure.

  abstract = {A species’ range can be limited when there is no genetic variation for a trait that allows for adaptation to more extreme environments. We study how range expansion occurs by the establishment of a new mutation that affects a quantitative trait in a spatially continuous population. The optimal phenotype for the trait varies linearly in space. The survival probabilities of new mutations affecting the trait are found by simulation. Shallow environmental gradients favour mutations that arise nearer to the range margin and that have smaller phenotypic effects than do steep gradients. Mutations that become established in shallow environmental gradients typically result in proportionally larger range expansions than those that establish in steep gradients. Mutations that become established in populations with high maximum growth rates tend to originate nearer to the range edge and to cause relatively smaller range expansion than mutations that establish in populations with low maximum growth rates. Under plausible parameter values, mutations that allow for range expansion tend to have large phenotypic effects (more than one phenotypic standard deviation) and cause substantial range expansions (15% or more). Sexual reproduction allows for larger range expansions and adaptation to more extreme environments than asexual reproduction.},

@article{kirkpatrick2013evolutionary,
  abstract = {A factor that may limit the ability of many populations to adapt to changing conditions is the rate at which beneficial mutations can become established. We study the probability that mutations become established in changing environments by extending the classic theory for branching processes. When environments change in time, under quite general conditions, the establishment probability is approximately twice the 'effective selection coefficient', whose value is an average that gives most weight to a mutant's fitness in the generations immediately after it appears. When fitness varies along a gradient in a continuous habitat, increased dispersal generally decreases the chance a mutation establishes because mutations move out of areas where they are most adapted. When there is a patch of favourable habitat that moves in time, there is a maximum speed of movement above which mutations cannot become established, regardless of when and where they first appear. This critical speed limit, which is proportional to the mutation's maximum selective advantage, represents an absolute constraint on the potential of locally adapted mutations to contribute to evolutionary rescue.},

We propose a new approach, spatial ancestry analysis, for the modeling of genotypes in two- or three-dimensional space. In spatial ancestry analysis (SPA), we explicitly model the spatial distribution of each SNP by assigning an allele frequency as a continuous function in geographic space. We show that the explicit modeling of the allele frequency allows individuals to be localized on the map on the basis of their genetic information alone. We apply our SPA method to a European and a worldwide population genetic variation data set and identify SNPs showing large gradients in allele frequency, and we suggest these as candidate regions under selection. These regions include SNPs in the well-characterized LCT region, as well as at loci including FOXP2, OCA2 and LRP1B.},

We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

Despite the ubiquity of IBD in nature, many commonly used statistical tests are based on a null model that is completely non-spatial, the Island model. Here, I argue that patterns of spatial autocorrelation deriving from IBD present a problem for such tests as it can severely bias their outcome. I use simulated data to illustrate this problem for two widely used types of tests: tests of hierarchical population structure and the detection of loci under selection. My results show that for both types of tests the presence of IBD can indeed lead to a large number of false positives. I therefore argue that all analyses in a study should take the spatial dependence in the data into account, unless it can be shown that there is no spatial autocorrelation in the allele frequency distribution that is under investigation. Thus, it is urgent to develop additional statistical approaches that are based on a spatially explicit null model instead of the non-spatial Island model.},

The most striking finding is a clear signal of admixture into northern Europe, with one ancestral population related to present day Basques and Sardinians, and the other related to present day populations of northeast Asia and the Americas. This likely reflects a history of admixture between Neolithic migrants and the indigenous Mesolithic population of Europe, consistent with recent analyses of ancient bones from Sweden and the sequencing of the genome of the Tyrolean 'Iceman'.},

Models suggest that the rate of displacement of native by invasive alleles can be rapid and inevitable if they are favored by natural selection. We document the spread of a few introduced genes 90 km into a threatened native species (the California Tiger Salamander) in 60 years. Meanwhile, a majority of genetic markers (65 of 68) show little evidence of spread beyond the region where introductions occurred. Using computer simulations, we found that such a pattern is unlikely to emerge by chance among selectively neutral markers. Therefore, our results imply that natural selection has favored both the movement and fixation of these exceptional invasive alleles. The legal status of introgressed populations (native populations that are slightly genetically modified) is unresolved by the US Endangered Species Act. Our results illustrate that genetic and ecological factors need to be carefully weighed when considering different criteria for protection, because different rules could result in dramatically different geographic areas and numbers of individuals being protected.},

  abstract = {A major goal of landscape genetics is to understand how landscapes structure genetic variation in natural populations. However, landscape genetics still lacks a framework for quantifying the effects of landscape features, such as habitat type, on realized gene flow. Here, we present a methodology for identifying the costs of dispersal through different habitats for the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense), an endangered species restricted to grassland/vernal pool habitat mosaics. We sampled larvae from all 16 breeding ponds in a geographically restricted area of vernal pool habitat at the Fort Ord Natural Reserve, Monterey County, California. We estimated between-pond gene flow using 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci and constructed GIS data layers of habitat types in our study area. We then used least-cost path analysis to determine the relative costs of movement through each habitat that best match rates of gene flow measured by our genetic data. We identified four measurable rates of gene flow between pairs of ponds, with between 10.5\% and 19.9\% of larvae having immigrant ancestry. Although A. californiense is typically associated with breeding ponds in grassland habitat, we found that dispersal through grassland is nearly twice as costly as dispersal through chaparral and that oak woodland is by far the most costly habitat to traverse. With the increasing availability of molecular resources and GIS data, we anticipate that these methods could be applied to a broad range of study systems, particularly those with cryptic life histories that make direct observation of movement challenging.},

Some of these introductions are relatively well known and have resulted in the formation of hybrids with the imperiled native California tiger salamander ( A. californiense ). Other populations of A. tigrinum , particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the state, remain poorly characterized and are present in regions where relictual amphibian populations of other species have persisted, suggesting that these might be relictual, native A. tigrinum . We used genetic sequence data to determine the provenance of all known extralimital A. tigrinum populations in California and adjacent Oregon and Nevada through comparison with reference samples from the native range of A. tigrinum . Our results suggest that A. tigrinum have been introduced in Northern California, Southern California and the Sierra Nevada, originating from multiple sources across the Great Plains of the US. Furthermore, two populations near the California-Oregon border are most closely related to A. tigrinum populations from Washington and Oregon and may represent native tiger salamander lineages.},

  abstract = {Vector organisms are implicated in the transmission of close to a third of all infectious diseases. In many cases, multiple vectors (species or populations) can participate in transmission but may contribute differently to disease ecology and evolution. The presence of cryptic vector populations can be particularly problematic as differences in infection can be difficult to evaluate and may lead to erroneous evolutionary and epidemiological inferences. Here, we combine site-occupancy modeling and molecular assays to evaluate patterns of infection in the marine cycle of Lyme borreliosis, involving colonial seabirds, the tick Ixodes uriae, and bacteria of the Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. complex. In this cycle, the tick vector consists of multiple, cryptic (phenotypically undistinguishable but genetically distinct) host races that are frequently found in sympatry. Our results show that bacterial detection varies strongly among tick races leading to vector-specific biases if raw counts are used to calculate Borrelia prevalence. These differences are largely explained by differences in infection intensity among tick races. After accounting for detection probabilities, we found that overall prevalence in this system is higher than previously suspected and that certain vector–host combinations likely contribute more than others to the local dynamics and large-scale dispersal of Borrelia spirochetes. These results highlight the importance of evaluating vector population structure and accounting for detection probability when trying to understand the evolutionary ecology of vector-borne diseases.},

  abstract = {Resurgence of illicit trade in African elephant ivory is placing the elephant at renewed risk. Regulation of this trade could be vastly improved by the ability to verify the geographic origin of tusks. We address this need by developing a combined genetic and statistical method to determine the origin of poached ivory. Our statistical approach exploits a smoothing method to estimate geographic-specific allele frequencies over the entire African elephants' range for 16 microsatellite loci, using 315 tissue and 84 scat samples from forest (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) and savannah (Loxodonta africana africana) elephants at 28 locations. These geographic-specific allele frequency estimates are used to infer the geographic origin of DNA samples, such as could be obtained from tusks of unknown origin. We demonstrate that our method alleviates several problems associated with standard assignment methods in this context, and the absolute accuracy of our method is high. Continent-wide, 50% of samples were located within 500 km, and 80% within 932 km of their actual place of origin. Accuracy varied by region (median accuracies: West Africa, 135 km; Central Savannah, 286 km; Central Forest, 411 km; South, 535 km; and East, 697 km). In some cases, allele frequencies vary considerably over small geographic regions, making much finer discriminations possible and suggesting that resolution could be further improved by collection of samples from locations not represented in our study.},

By sequencing the genomes of twenty additional individuals from a global set of marine and freshwater populations, we identify a genome-wide set of loci that are consistently associated with marine-freshwater divergence. Our results indicate that reuse of globally shared standing genetic variation, including chromosomal inversions, has an important role in repeated evolution of distinct marine and freshwater sticklebacks, and in the maintenance of divergent ecotypes during early stages of reproductive isolation. Both coding and regulatory changes occur in the set of loci underlying marine-freshwater evolution, but regulatory changes appear to predominate in this well known example of repeated adaptive evolution in nature.},

Further, we characterized the pattern of historical recombination in A. thaliana and observed an enrichment of hotspots in its intergenic regions and repetitive DNA, which is consistent with the pattern that is observed for humans but which is strikingly different from that observed in other plant species.

evolutionary analyses. Empirical tests of the theory, however, are challenging
because of the complex relationships between space, dispersal, and evolution.
Critically, we lack quantitative validation of the spatial models of population
genetics. Here we combine analytics, on and off-lattice simulations, and
experiments with bacteria to perform quantitative tests of the theory. We study
two bacterial species, the gut microbe Escherichia coli and the opportunistic
pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and show that spatio-genetic patterns in
colony biofilms of both species are accurately described by an extension of the
one-dimensional stepping-stone model. We use one empirical measure, genetic
diversity at the colony periphery, to parameterize our models and show that we
can then accurately predict another key variable: the degree of short-range
cell migration along an edge. Moreover, the model allows us to estimate other
key parameters including effective population size (density) at the expansion
frontier. While our experimental system is a simplification of natural
microbial community, we argue it is a proof of principle that the spatial
models of population genetics can quantitatively capture organismal evolution.

Although population structure appears to have a minor impact on the current generation of genome-wide association studies, it is likely to have a significant part in the next generation of studies designed to search for rare variants. A powerful way of detecting such structure is to control and document carefully the provenance of the samples involved. In this study, we describe the collection of a cohort of rural UK samples (The People of the British Isles), aimed at providing a well-characterised UK-control population that can be used as a resource by the research community, as well as providing a fine-scale genetic information on the British population. So far, some 4000 samples have been collected, the majority of which fit the criteria of coming from a rural area and having all four grandparents from approximately the same area. Analysis of the first 3865 samples that have been geocoded indicates that 75% have a mean distance between grandparental places of birth of 37.3 km, and that about 70% of grandparental places of birth can be classed as rural. Preliminary genotyping of 1057 samples demonstrates the value of these samples for investigating a fine-scale population structure within the UK, and shows how this can be enhanced by the use of surnames.},

@article{kim2011hitchhiking,
  abstract = {A central problem in population genetics is to detect and analyze positive natural selection by which beneficial mutations are driven to fixation. The hitchhiking effect of a rapidly spreading beneficial mutation, which results in local removal of standing genetic variation, allows such an analysis using DNA sequence polymorphism. However, the current mathematical theory that predicts the pattern of genetic hitchhiking relies on the assumption that a beneficial mutation increases to a high frequency in a single random-mating population, which is certainly violated in reality. Individuals in natural populations are distributed over a geographic space. The spread of a beneficial allele can be delayed by limited migration of individuals over the space and its hitchhiking effect can also be affected. To study this effect of geographic structure on genetic hitchhiking, we analyze a simple model of directional selection in a subdivided population. In contrast to previous studies on hitchhiking in subdivided populations, we mainly investigate the range of sufficiently high migration rates that would homogenize genetic variation at neutral loci. We provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the overall strength of genetic hitchhiking - the degree to which expected heterozygosity decreases - is diminished by population subdivision, mainly because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations. This raises a possibility of detecting a "hidden" geographic structure of population by carefully analyzing the pattern of a selective sweep.},

  abstract = {Abstract
We examined patterns of nucleotide diversity at a genomic region containing two linked candidate disease resistance (NBS-LRR) genes in seven populations of the outcrossing plant Arabidopsis lyrata. In comparison with two adjacent control genes and neutral reference genes across the genome, the NBS-LRR genes exhibited elevated nonsynonymous variation and a large number of major-effect polymorphisms causing early stop codons and/or frameshift mutations. In contrast, analysis of synonymous diversity provided no evidence that the region was subject to long-term balancing selection or recent selective sweeps in any of the seven populations surveyed. Also in contrast with earlier surveys of one of these R genes, there was no evidence that the resistance genes or the major-effect mutations were subject to elevated differentiation between populations. We suggest that conditional neutrality in the absence of the corresponding pathogen, rather than long-term balancing selection or local adaptation, may in some circumstances be a significant cause of elevated functional polymorphism at R genes. In contrast with the R genes, analysis of diversity and differentiation at the flanking FERONIA locus showed high population divergence, suggesting local adaptation on this locus controlling male–female signalling during fertilization.},

More than 50 years ago, it was suggested that the gene responsible for this disorder could reach high frequencies because of resistance conferred against malaria by the heterozygous carrier state. This traditional example of balancing selection is known as the 'malaria hypothesis'. However, the geographical relationship between the transmission intensity of malaria and associated HbS burden has never been formally investigated on a global scale. Here, we use a comprehensive data assembly of HbS allele frequencies to generate the first evidence-based map of the worldwide distribution of the gene in a Bayesian geostatistical framework. We compare this map with the pre-intervention distribution of malaria endemicity, using a novel geostatistical area-mean comparison. We find geographical support for the malaria hypothesis globally; the relationship is relatively strong in Africa but cannot be resolved in the Americas or in Asia.},

@article{ralph2010parallel,
  abstract = {Models for detecting the effect of adaptation on population genomic diversity are often predicated on a single newly arisen mutation sweeping rapidly to fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new environment by multiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel, at the same locus or different loci. These mutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single one from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally, leading to a "soft" sweep in the population. Here we study various models of parallel mutation in a continuous, geographically spread population adapting to a global selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele due to limited dispersal can allow other selected alleles to arise and start to spread elsewhere in the species range. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow dramatically and so initially form a geographic patchwork, a random tessellation, which could be mistaken for a signal of local adaptation. This spatial tessellation will dissipate over time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within the global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed by mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of crystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel mutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs are captured by a single compound parameter, a characteristic length, which reflects the expected distance a spreading allele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This characteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter, the effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the strength of selection. While our knowledge of these parameters is poor, we argue that even in widely dispersing species, such parallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict that as more data become available, many more examples of intraspecies parallel adaptation will be uncovered.

  abstract = {Various observations argue for a role of adaptation in recent human evolution, including results from genome-wide studies and analyses of selection signals at candidate genes. Here, we use genome-wide SNP data from the HapMap and CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel samples to study the geographic distributions of putatively selected alleles at a range of geographic scales. We find that the average allele frequency divergence is highly predictive of the most extreme F(ST) values across the whole genome. On a broad scale, the geographic distribution of putatively selected alleles almost invariably conforms to population clusters identified using randomly chosen genetic markers. Given this structure, there are surprisingly few fixed or nearly fixed differences between human populations. Among the nearly fixed differences that do exist, nearly all are due to fixation events that occurred outside of Africa, and most appear in East Asia. These patterns suggest that selection is often weak enough that neutral processes -- especially population history, migration, and drift -- exert powerful influences over the fate and geographic distribution of selected alleles.},

@article{conrad2006haplotypevariation,
  abstract = {Recent genomic surveys have produced high-resolution haplotype information, but only in a small number of human populations. We report haplotype structure across 12 Mb of DNA sequence in 927 individuals representing 52 populations. The geographic distribution of haplotypes reflects human history, with a loss of haplotype diversity as distance increases from Africa. Although the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) varies markedly across populations, considerable sharing of haplotype structure exists, and inferred recombination hotspot locations generally match across groups. The four samples in the International HapMap Project contain the majority of common haplotypes found in most populations: averaging across populations, 83\% of common 20-kb haplotypes in a population are also common in the most similar HapMap sample. Consequently, although the portability of tag SNPs based on the HapMap is reduced in low-LD Africans, the HapMap will be helpful for the design of genome-wide association mapping studies in nearly all human populations.

@article{smith1969localfluctuations,
  abstract = {    Most populations are divided into small villages or towns or similar communities. Gene
 frequencies will certainly vary from community to community, even if only because of random
 variations. It is possible that selective forces might also cause similar fluctuations. It is therefore
 important to know how much variability is to be expected, to compare it with the amount
 actually observed.
    In work on blood-group frequency the phenotype frequencies in neighbouring populations are
 often compared by a x2 test, to see whether they differ `significantly'. This test is clearly not
 appropriate. In comparing samples by x2 the null hypothesis is that they are drawn at random
from the same large population, or from large populations with similar constitutions. This does
not mean anything reasonable for villages. Each village will continue to develop more or less
on its own from generation to generation with only limited migration from nejghbours. The
frequency fluctuations in each generation will be added to those of preceding generations. Hence
the variability in gene frequency will accumulate. The x2 test would be appropriate if the
villages had been at one stroke carved out of a single homogeneous population.
   Much work has been done on the extent of random drift in populations. Accounts are to be
found in, for example, Li (1955, chapter 23)) Moran (1962, chapters 6 and 7) and Kimura (1964).
But in order to make the algebra mathematically tractable it has so far been necessary to use
rather simple model situations. This makes it difficult a t present to apply the theory to obser-
vational data.
   There seems to be room for an approximate method of dealing with the situation, at least
until the exact theory has been successfully extended to deal with more complicated situations.
What follows is a first attempt at this. It is based on the idea that variance is introduced into a
population in each generation by random drift (and to a small extent by random mutation).
The variance may be reduced by selection or mutation, which tend to bring the population back
to an equilibrium state, and by migration between communities, which tends to make them
uniform. By adding together the amounts of incoming variance, and taking into account that
lost by other processes, we should obtain the expected amount of variation in gene frequency
present a t any one time.

@article{feder2010divergencehitchhiking,
  abstract = {Genes under divergent selection flow less readily between populations than other loci. This observation has led to verbal “divergence hitchhiking” models of speciation in which decreased interpopulation gene flow surrounding loci under divergent selection can generate large regions of differentiation within the genome (genomic islands). The efficacy of this model in promoting speciation depends on the size of the region affected by divergence hitchhiking. Empirical evidence is mixed, with examples of both large and small genomic islands. To address these empirical discrepancies and to formalize the theory, we present mathematical models of divergence hitchhiking, which examine neutral differentiation around selected sites. For a single locus under selection, regions of differentiation do not extend far along a chromosome away from a selected site unless both effective population sizes and migration rates are low. When multiple loci are considered, regions of differentiation can be larger. However, with many loci under selection, genome-wide divergence occurs and genomic islands are erased. The results show that divergence hitchhiking can generate large regions of differentiation, but that the conditions under which this occurs are limited. Thus, speciation may often require multifarious selection acting on many, isolated and physically unlinked genes. How hitchhiking promotes further adaptive divergence warrants consideration.},

Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations. Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing; an individual's DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy-often to within a few hundred kilometres.},

@article{bierne2010distinctive,
  abstract = {Loci with higher levels of population differentiation than the neutral expectation are traditionally interpreted as evidence of ongoing selection that varies in space. This article emphasizes an alternative explanation that has been largely overlooked to date: in species subdivided into large subpopulations, enhanced differentiation can also be the signature left by the fixation of an unconditionally favorable mutation on its chromosomal neighborhood. This is because the hitchhiking effect is expected to diminish as the favorable mutation spreads from the deme in which it originated to other demes. To discriminate among the two alternative scenarios one needs to investigate how genetic structure varies along the chromosomal region of the locus. Local hitchhiking is shown to generate a single sharp peak of differentiation centered on the adaptive polymorphism and the standard signature of a selective sweep only in those subpopulations in which the allele is favored. Global hitchhiking produces two domes of differentiation on either side of the fixed advantageous mutation and signatures of a selective sweep in every subpopulation, albeit of different magnitude. Investigating population differentiation around a locus that strongly differentiates two otherwise genetically similar populations of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis, plausible evidence for the global hitchhiking hypothesis has been obtained. Global hitchhiking is a neglected phenomenon that might prove to be important in species with large population sizes such as many marine invertebrates.},

@misc{schreiber2010invasion,
  abstract = {  We live in a time where climate models predict future increases in
environmental variability and biological invasions are becoming increasingly
frequent. A key to developing effective responses to biological invasions in
increasingly variable environments will be estimates of their rates of spatial
spread and the associated uncertainty of these estimates. Using stochastic,
stage-structured, integro-difference equation models, we show analytically that
invasion speeds are asymptotically normally distributed with a variance that
decreases in time. We apply our methods to a simple juvenile-adult model with
stochastic variation in reproduction and an illustrative example with published
data for the perennial herb, \emph{Calathea ovandensis}. These examples
buttressed by additional analysis reveal that increased variability in vital
rates simultaneously slow down invasions yet generate greater uncertainty about
rates of spatial spread. Moreover, while temporal autocorrelations in vital
rates inflate variability in invasion speeds, the effect of these
autocorrelations on the average invasion speed can be positive or negative
depending on life history traits and how well vital rates ``remember'' the
past.

@article{barton2010continuum,
  abstract = {We investigate a new model for populations evolving in a spatial continuum. This model can be thought of as a spatial version of the Lambda-Fleming-Viot process. It explicitly incorporates both small scale reproduction events and large scale extinction-recolonisation events. The lineages ancestral to a sample from a population evolving according to this model can be described in terms of a spatial version of the Lambda-coalescent. Using a technique of Evans (1997), we prove existence and uniqueness in law for the model. We then investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the genealogy of a finite number of individuals sampled uniformly at random (or more generally `far enough apart') from a two-dimensional torus of sidelength L as L tends to infinity. Under appropriate conditions (and on a suitable timescale) we can obtain as limiting genealogical processes a Kingman coalescent, a more general Lambda-coalescent or a system of coalescing Brownian motions (with a non-local coalescence mechanism).

@article{barton2010phylogeography,
  abstract = { Classical models of gene flow fail in three ways: they cannot explain large-scale patterns; they predict much more genetic diversity than is observed; and they assume that loosely linked genetic loci evolve independently. We propose a new model that deals with these problems. Extinction events kill some fraction of individuals in a region. These are replaced by offspring from a small number of parents, drawn from the preexisting population. This model of evolution forwards in time corresponds to a backwards model, in which ancestral lineages jump to a new location if they are hit by an event, and may coalesce with other lineages that are hit by the same event. We derive an expression for the identity in allelic state, and show that, over scales much larger than the largest event, this converges to the classical value derived by Wright and Malécot. However, rare events that cover large areas cause low genetic diversity, large-scale patterns, and correlations in ancestry between unlinked loci.

@article{pollak1966survival,
  abstract = {A classical problem in population genetics consists in finding the probability that a line descending from a particular gene $A$ will become extinct. A simple assumption [R. A. Fisher, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh 42 (1922), 321--341; J. B. S. Haldane, Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 23 (1927), 838--844] is that of a large population where, initially, the number of $A$-genes is small. Another assumption [R. A. Fisher, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh 50 (1930), 204--219; S. Wright, Genetics 16 (1931), 97--159] is that of a population with a constant number $N$ of genes where $A$ has a certain selective disadvantage over another gene $\overline A$.

The present author considers $K$ subpopulations which inhabit $K$ different ecological niches with possible migration between the niches. First, it is assumed that there is no limit to the size a population can attain and that the $A$-genes reproduce independently of each other. Let $\pi_i\ (i=1,2,\cdots,K)$ be the conditional probability that the line descending from an $A$-gene becomes extinct if the ancestral gene of the line is in niche $i$; the probability that $A$ survives is then expressible in terms of the $\pi_i$. Next, we assume that the population possesses a large but finite number $N_i$ of genes ($A$ or $\overline A$) in niche $i$. If certain assumptions of independence are made, then the probability that $A$ survives is approximated by a function of the above $\pi_i$, provided these are not all equal to unity. },

@article{cavallisforza1966consanguineous,
  abstract = {                                    SUMMARY
   Theories were developed to predict the frequencies of various types of con- sanguineous marriages based on demographic data of migration patterns, age distributions, and similarity of mates in the general population. The effect of migration was formulated both with discrete and continuous models. In the former, the entire population is subdivided into discrete groups (villages etc.) and migration and marriage are treated using transition and matrimonial migration matrices. It was then shown that the method of matrix algebra leads to simple expressions of the results. However, information is not at the moment sufficient to construct numerically the migration and marriage matrices to treat the actual cases, but may become available in the future. On the other hand, using continu- ous models, fitting of either biexponential or trinormal distribution to migration distances allows us to predict the frequencies observed in an actual case (the Parma Valley area) when age effect on marriage is also taken into account.-The agreement between observed and expected results for Parma is only fair. In part, at least, this seems to be the consequence of the inadequacy of the demographic information now available and that should be improved by future research.-As an indicator for the breeding structure of populations, the probabilities of con- sanguineous marriages should have an important bearing especially for human population genetics.

@article{santiago2005hitchhiking,
  abstract = {The effect of genetic hitchhiking on neutral variation is analyzed in subdivided populations with differentiated demes. After fixation of a favorable mutation, the consequences on particular subpopulations can be radically different. In the subpopulation where the mutation first appeared by mutation, variation at linked neutral loci is expected to be reduced, as predicted by the classical theory. However, the effect in the other subpopulations, where the mutation is introduced by migration, can be the opposite. This effect depends on the level of genetic differentiation of the subpopulations, the selective advantage of the mutation, the recombination frequency, and the population size, as stated by analytical derivations and computer simulations. The characteristic outcomes of the effect are three. First, the genomic region of reduced variation around the selected locus is smaller than that predicted in a panmictic population. Second, for more distant neutral loci, the amount of variation increases over the level they had before the hitchhiking event. Third, for these loci, the spectrum of gene frequencies is dominated by an excess of alleles at intermediate frequencies when compared with the neutral theory. At these loci, hitchhiking works like a system that takes variation from the between-subpopulation component and introduces it into the subpopulations. The mechanism can also operate in other systems in which the genetic variation is distributed in clusters with limited exchange of variation, such as chromosome arrangements or genomic regions closely linked to targets of balancing selection.

The approximate method used in the paper is valid when the number of emigrants per generation (Nm) is less than one. The approximate analysis shows that hitch-hiking can result in substantial differences among populations in the frequencies of neutral alleles closely linked to the advantageous allele. Thus, in cases for which genetic hitch-hiking is thought to be responsible for low levels of genetic variability in regions of the genome with restricted crossing over, it might be possible to find confirmatory evidence for that hypothesis by finding unusual patterns of geographic differentiation in the same regions of the genome.},

We consider the effects of geographic structure on variation within and between local populations, first in general terms, and then for specific migration models. We discuss the close parallels between geographic structure and stable types of genetic structure caused by selection, including balancing selection and background selection. The effects of departures from stability, such as selective sweeps and population bottlenecks, are also described. Methods for distinguishing population history from the effects of ongoing gene flow are discussed. We relate the theoretical results to observed patterns of variation in natural populations.},

By calculating the probability of joint occupancy of two locations at a distance x, it is shown that a haploid model embodying the latter two assumptions violates the first, forming larger and larger clumps of individuals separated by greater and greater distances. Thus the model is biologically irrelevant, even though it is possible to use it to calculate probabilities of genetic identity at different distances. The formation of these clumps is verified by computer simulation. The same phenomenon occurs in two- and three-dimensional models. In models of finite regions (a circle or a torus), the formation of clumps takes the form of the certainty of ultimate local extinction of the organism in each region. This does not occur if we hold the number of individuals on the circle or torus constant, but considerable departure from random distribution still results. The stepping-stone models appear for the present to be the only well-defined models of geographically structured populations with finite population density.},

  abstract = {A local barrier to gene flow will delay the spread of an advantageous allele. Exact calculations for the deterministic case show that an allele that is favorable when rare is delayed very little even by a strong barrier: its spread is slowed by a time proportional to log((B/sigma) square root of 2S)/S, where B is the barrier strength, sigma the dispersal range, and fitnesses are 1:1 + S:1 + 2S. However, when there is selection against heterozygotes, such that the allele cannot increase from low frequency, a barrier can cause a much greater delay. If gene flow is reduced below a critical value, spread is entirely prevented. Stochastic simulations show that with additive selection, random drift slows down the spread of the allele, below the deterministic speed of sigma square root of 2S. The delay to the advance of an advantageous allele caused by a strong barrier can be substantially increased by random drift and increases with B/(2S rho sigma 2) in a one-dimensional habitat of density rho. However, with selection against heterozygotes, drift can facilitate the spread and can free an allele that would otherwise be trapped indefinitely by a strong barrier. We discuss the implications of these results for the evolution of chromosome rearrangements.},

  abstract = {Approximate results for the probabilities of fixation and expected times to fixation of mutant alleles in a subdivided population are obtained. For given selection in each local population and symmetric migration between local populations, the fixation probabilities of new mutant alleles can be bounded by the value for a panmictic population of the same total size and a value obtained by assuming fixation takes place in each deme independently. These are the high and low migration limits. It is shown that if the mutant in the heterozygous state has a fitness of less than one half of the two homozygote fitnesses, the fixation probability is higher in the low migration limit than in the high migration limit. The reverse is true for the case of the heterozygote being more fit than the average of the homozygotes. The average times to fixation can be bounded by the values for a panmictic population and for the low migration limit. It is shown that the expected time to fixation increases with the inverse of the migration rate among the demes.},

@article{1992,
  abstract = {Although heritable genetic variation is critical to the evolutionary process, we know little about how it is maintained. Obviously, mutation-selection balance must play a role, but there is considerable doubt over whether it can account for heritabilities as high as 0.5, which are commonly found in natural populations. Most models of mutation-selection balance assume panmictic populations. In this paper we use Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effect of isolation by distance on the variation maintained by mutation in a polygenic trait subject to optimizing selection. We show that isolation by distance can substantially increase the total variation maintained in continuous populations over a wide range of dispersal patterns, but only if more than one genotype produces the optimal phenotype (genetic redundancy). Isolation by distance alone has only a slight effect on the variation maintained in the total population for neutral alleles. The combined effect of isolation by distance and genetic redundancy, however, allows the maintenance of substantial variation despite strong stabilizing selection. The mechanism is straightforward. Isolation by distance allows mutation and drift to operate independently in different parts of the population. Because of their independent evolutionary histories, different parts of the population independently draw from the available set of redundant genotypes. Because the genotypes are redundant, selection does not discriminate among them, and they will persist until eliminated by drift. The population as a whole maintains many distinct genotypes. We show that this process allows mutation to maintain high levels of variation, even under strong stabilizing selection, and that over a moderate range of dispersal patterns the amount of variation maintained in the entire population is independent of both the strength of selection and the variance of the dispersal distance. Furthermore, we show that individual heterozygosity is increased in locally mating populations when selection is strong. Finally, our simulations provide a rough picture of how selection and the dispersal pattern influence the spatial distribution of genetic and phenotypic variation.},

@article{mcvean2009genealogical,
  abstract = {Genetic variation in natural populations typically demonstrates structure arising from diverse processes including geographical isolation, founder events, migration, and admixture. One technique commonly used to uncover such structure is principal components analysis, which identifies the primary axes of variation in data and projects the samples onto these axes in a graphically appealing and intuitive manner. However, as the method is non-parametric, it can be hard to relate PCA to underlying process. Here, I show that the underlying genealogical history of the samples can be related directly to the PC projection. The result is useful because it is straightforward to predict the effects of different demographic processes on the sample genealogy. However, the result also reveals the limitations of PCA, in that multiple processes can give the same projections, it is strongly influenced by uneven sampling, and it discards important information in the spatial structure of genetic variation along chromosomes.

We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general “phase change” phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like $F_{ST}$) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

On splitting, each particle is replaced by its daughter particles and they then follow independent Brownian motions until they split. The branching process is assumed to be critical. Let $N_A(t)$ be the number of particles in the bounded set $A$, of Lebesgue measure $m(A)$, at the time $t$.

It is shown that if there is only one particle initially and the movement of the particles occurs in the plane then $c_2(tlogt)P[N_A(t)>c_1m(A)\lambda\log t]\rightarrow e^{-\lambda}$ for $\lambda>0$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are specified constants. The method of proof is to obtain good estimates of $E[N_A(t)^k]$ for all $k$ and hence of the moment generating function of $N_A(t)/(m(A)\log t)$; from this the result is derived. If the set of initial particles forms a homogeneous Poisson process of unit rate in the plane (in fact, a slightly weaker assumption, as made by the author, is sufficient), then $c_3logtP[N_A(t)>c_1m(A)\lambda\log t]\rightarrow e^{-\lambda}$ for $\lambda>0$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$, where $c_1$ and $c_3$ are specified constants. },

Statistical measures of the spatial pattern are defined in such a way that the same quantities could be measured in a geographic survey of allele frequencies in natural populations. Two types of quantities are discussed in this paper: (1) the occupancy distribution provides information on the presence or absence of the mutant in different numbers of demes; and (2) the conditional frequency distribution provides information about the extent of local differentiation when the mutant is present in different numbers of demes. Properties of these distributions are found for different types of natural selection acting on the mutant. Some results are presented for the same statistical measures based on samples of individuals from a fraction of the total number of demes. The simulation results for intermediate levels of the migration rates are compared with analytic results obtained on the limits of high and low migration rates. The main conclusion is that these measures of the spatial distribution of mutants in a subdivided population have simple properties that could provide a new perspective on data from natural populations.},

@article{ben-schreiber-persistence,
  abstract = {Environmental fluctuations often have different impacts on individuals that differ in size, age, or spatial location. To understand how population structure, environmental fluctuations, and density-dependent interactions influence population dynamics, we provide a general theory for persistence for density-dependent matrix models in random environments. For populations with compensating density dependence, exhibiting “bounded” dynamics, and living in a stationary environment, we show that persistence is determined by the stochastic growth rate (alternatively, dominant Lyapunov exponent) when the population is rare. If this stochastic growth rate is negative, then the total population abundance goes to zero with probability one. If this stochastic growth rate is positive, there is a unique positive stationary distribution. Provided there are initially some individuals in the population, the population converges in distribution to this stationary distribution and the empirical measures almost surely converge to the distribution of the stationary distribution. For models with overcompensating density-dependence, weaker results are proven. Methods to estimate stochastic growth rates are presented. To illustrate the utility of these results, applications to unstructured, spatially structured, and stage-structured population models are given. For instance, we show that diffusively coupled sink populations can persist provided that within patch fitness is sufficiently variable in time but not strongly correlated across space.},

  abstract = {Understanding the factors that determine the continued survival of small populations is a central problem in conservation biology. The Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) naturally occurs in small, isolated populations throughout much of the American Southwest. In spite of this distributional pattern, the species is neither rare nor endangered. Thus it appears to have successfully "solved" the problems to the problems of habitat fragmentation. We used data from a 10—yr field study and simulation models to examine the effects of environmental stochasticity on population survival times. All simulated woodpecker populations went extinct within 49 yr, and the median survival time was only 16 yr. However, when immigration was allowed, persistence times greatly increased; with an immigrant rate of only five individuals per year, most populations lasted >1000 yr. The results of this and other analyses suggest that this population persists only because it is part of a larger "metapopulation," and because it is regularly rescued from extinction by immigration from other, independently varying, populations. This finding has important implications for the development of management strategies designed to preserve small populations that are faced with fragmented distributional patterns and high levels of environmental variation.},

  abstract = {Local adaptation of parasites to their sympatric hosts has been investigated on different biological systems through reciprocal transplant experiments. Most of these studies revealed a local adaptation of the parasite. In several cases, however, parasites were found to be locally maladapted or neither adapted nor maladapted. In the present paper, we try to determine the causes of such variability in these results. We analyse a host–parasite metapopulation model and study the effect of several factors on the emergence of local adaptation: population sizes, mutation rates and migration rates for both the host and the parasite, and parasite generation time. We show that all these factors may act on local adaptation through their effects on the evolutionary potential of each species. In particular, we find that higher numbers of mutants or migrants do, in general, promote local adaptation. Interestingly, shorter parasite generation time does not always favour parasite local adaptation. When genetic variability is limiting, shorter generation time, via an increase of the strength of selection, decreases the capacity of the parasite to adapt to an evolving host.},

  abstract = {There is abundant geographic variation in both morphology and gene frequency in most species. The extent of geographic variation results from a balance of forces tending to produce local genetic differentiation and forces tending to produce genetic homogeneity. Mutation, genetic drift due to finite population size, and natural selection favoring adaptations to local environmental conditions will all lead to the genetic differentiation of local populations, and the movement of gametes, individuals, and even entire populations--collectively called gene flow--will oppose that differentiation. Gene flow may either constrain evolution by preventing adaptation to local conditions or promote evolution by spreading new genes and combinations of genes throughout a species' range. Several methods are available for estimating the amount of gene flow. Direct methods monitor ongoing gene flow, and indirect methods use spatial distributions of gene frequencies to infer past gene flow. Applications of these methods show that species differ widely in the gene flow that they experience. Of particular interest are those species for which direct methods indicate little current gene flow but indirect methods indicate much higher levels of gene flow in the recent past. Such species probably have undergone large-scale demographic changes relatively frequently. },

  abstract = {Co-evolutionary trajectories of host–parasite interactions are strongly affected by the antagonists' evolutionary potential, which in turn depends on population sizes as well as levels of recombination, mutation, and gene flow. Under similar selection pressures, the opponent with the higher evolutionary rate is expected to lead the co-evolutionary arms race and to develop local adaptations. Here, we use mitochondrial DNA sequence data and microsatellite markers to assess the amount of genetic variability and levels of gene flow in two host–parasite systems, each consisting of an ant social parasite — the European slavemaker Harpagoxenus sublaevis and the North American slavemaker Protomognathus americanus— and its two main host species. Our population genetic analyses revealed limited gene flow between individual populations of both host and parasite species, allowing for a geographic mosaic of co-evolution. In a between-system comparison, we found less genetic variability and more pronounced structure in Europe, where previous behavioural studies demonstrated strong local adaptation. Within the European host–parasite system, the larger host species Leptothorax acervorum exhibited higher levels of both genetic variability and gene flow, and previous field data showed that it is less affected by the social parasite H. sublaevis than the smaller host Leptothorax muscorum, which has genetically depleted and isolated populations. In North America, the parasite P. americanus showed higher levels of gene flow between sites, but overall less genetic diversity than its hyper-variable main host species, Temnothorax longispinosus. Interestingly, recent ecological and chemical studies demonstrated adaptation of P. americanus to local host populations, indicating the importance of migration in co-evolutionary interactions.

Phenotypic differences between populations may have a genetic basis, but showing that they reflect different adaptive optima requires the quantification of both gene flow and selection1, 2, 3. Good empirical data are rare4. Using data on a spatially structured island population of great tits (Parus major), we show here that a persistent difference in mean clutch size between two subpopulations only a few kilometres apart has a major genetic component. We also show that immigrants from outside the island carry genes for large clutches. But gene flow into one subpopulation is low, as a result of a low immigration rate together with strong selection against immigrant genes. This has allowed for adaptation to the island environment and the maintenance of small clutches. In the other area, however, higher gene flow prevents local adaptation and maintains larger clutches. We show that the observed small-scale genetic difference in clutch size is not due to divergent selection on the island, but to different levels of gene flow from outside the island. Our findings illustrate the large effect of immigration on the evolution of local adaptations and on genetic population structure.},

However, the vast majority of population genetic studies are based on populations in which every individual competes globally. Here we use experimental evolution in Escherichia coli to directly test a recently made prediction that spatial structure slows down adaptation and that this cost increases with the mutation rate. This was studied by comparing populations of different mutation rates adapting to a liquid (unstructured) medium with populations that evolved in a Petri dish on solid (structured) medium. We find that mutators adapt faster to both environments and that adaptation is slower if there is spatial structure. We observed no significant difference in the cost of structure between mutator and wild-type populations, which suggests that clonal interference is intense in both genetic backgrounds.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the authors study the dynamics of hybrid zones in the absence of selection: They consider a process $(ŋ_t)_{t\geq 0}$ with state space ${(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)}^{\bold Z^d\times {1,2}}$, where $(ŋ_t(x,1),ŋ_t(x,2))$ is a pair of genes which represent the state of the individual at site $x\in\bold Z^d$ at time $t$. It evolves according to a translation-invariant, irreducible, symmetric probability transition $p(·,·)$ on $\bold Z^d$ with finite second moments, in the following way. At rate 1, each individual is replaced by a new one: it chooses each of its two parents with probability $p(·,·)$, then picks at random one of the parents' two genes (all these choices being independent); the two genes obtained are the individual's new state. This description corresponds to a voter model [see T. M. Liggett, Interacting particle systems, Springer, New York, 1985; MR0776231 (86e:60089)]. Taking for initial configuration $(0,0)$ on sites $x\in\bold Z^d$ with $x_1\geq 0$, and $(1,1)$ if $x_1<0$ ($x_1$ is the first coordinate of $x$), the authors look at the evolution of the interface between 0's and 1's, which gives rise to a hybrid zone.

They show that, in dimension $d>1$, the width of the hybrid zone grows as $\sqrt t$. In dimension 1, assuming that $p(·,·)$ has finite third moments, they prove that the interface process is an irreducible, positive recurrent Markov chain, with an equilibrium distribution of infinite mean (except in the nearest neighbor case where nothing moves). The first step of the proofs transforms a particle system's problem into a random walk problem, because the voter model is in duality with coalescing random walks. The key tools are therefore refined properties of random walks (in particular, about the recurrent potential kernel), and these theorems are interesting on their own.

Finally, the authors illustrate their belief that tight interfaces are common in one-dimensional particle systems: They explain conjectures for the contact process [see T. M. Liggett, op. cit.], for a model of oxidation of carbon monoxide on a catalyst surface (defined by R. M. Ziff, E. Gulari and Y. Barshad [Phy. Rev. Lett. 56 (1986), no. 24, 2553--2556]), mention results on simple exclusion [see P. A. Ferrari, C. Kipnis and E. Saada, Ann.

This paper characterizes the statistical properties of spatial autocorrelation statistics in this context and develops estimators of gene dispersal based on data on standing patterns of genetic variation. Large numbers of Monte Carlo simulations and a wide variety of sampling strategies are utilized. The results show that spatial autocorrelation statistics are highly predictable and informative. Thus, strong hypothesis tests for neutral theory can be formulated. Most strikingly, robust estimators of gene dispersal can be obtained with practical sample sizes.

@article{elephant-ivory,
  abstract = {Resurgence of illicit trade in African elephant ivory is placing the elephant at renewed risk. Regulation of this trade could be vastly improved by the ability to verify the geographic origin of tusks. We address this need by developing a combined genetic and statistical method to determine the origin of poached ivory. Our statistical approach exploits a smoothing method to estimate geographic-specific allele frequencies over the entire African elephants' range for 16 microsatellite loci, using 315 tissue and 84 scat samples from forest (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) and savannah (Loxodonta africana africana) elephants at 28 locations. These geographic-specific allele frequency estimates are used to infer the geographic origin of DNA samples, such as could be obtained from tusks of unknown origin. We demonstrate that our method alleviates several problems associated with standard assignment methods in this context, and the absolute accuracy of our method is high. Continent-wide, 50% of samples were located within 500 km, and 80% within 932 km of their actual place of origin. Accuracy varied by region (median accuracies: West Africa, 135 km; Central Savannah, 286 km; Central Forest, 411 km; South, 535 km; and East, 697 km). In some cases, allele frequencies vary considerably over small geographic regions, making much finer discriminations possible and suggesting that resolution could be further improved by collection of samples from locations not represented in our study.},

@article{coop-adaptation-genes,
  abstract = {Evolutionary pressures due to variation in climate play an important role in shaping phenotypic variation among and within species and have been shown to influence variation in phenotypes such as body shape and size among humans. Genes involved in energy metabolism are likely to be central to heat and cold tolerance. To test the hypothesis that climate shaped variation in metabolism genes in humans, we used a bioinformatics approach based on network theory to select 82 candidate genes for common metabolic disorders. We genotyped 873 tag SNPs in these genes in 54 worldwide populations (including the 52 in the Human Genome Diversity Project panel) and found correlations with climate variables using rank correlation analysis and a newly developed method termed Bayesian geographic analysis. In addition, we genotyped 210 carefully matched control SNPs to provide an empirical null distribution for spatial patterns of allele frequency due to population history alone. For nearly all climate variables, we found an excess of genic SNPs in the tail of the distributions of the test statistics compared to the control SNPs, implying that metabolic genes as a group show signals of spatially varying selection. Among our strongest signals were several SNPs (e.g., LEPR R109K, FABP2 A54T) that had previously been associated with phenotypes directly related to cold tolerance. Since variation in climate may be correlated with other aspects of environmental variation, it is possible that some of the signals that we detected reflect selective pressures other than climate. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the idea that climate has been an important selective pressure acting on candidate genes for common metabolic disorders.},

  abstract = {The spatial genetic structure within sympatric populations of two neotropical dioecious palm species with contrasting life histories was characterized to evaluate the influence of life history traits on the extent of genetic isolation by distance. Chamaedorea tepejilote is a common wind-pollinated arboreal understory palm. Chamaedorea elatior is an uncommon climbing subcanopy palm with entomophilous pollination syndrome. A total of 59 allozyme alleles for C. tepejilote and 53 alleles for C. elatior was analyzed using both unweighted (Iu) and weighted (Iw) Moran's I spatial autocorrelation statistics. The spatial genetic structure detected within these populations is consistent with those reported for highly dispersed plants. A significance test for differences between mean Moran's I-coefficients revealed less spatial genetic structure within the C. tepejilote population than that in the C. elatior population. Adjacent individuals of C. elatior exhibited significant spatial genetic autocorrelation (Iu=0.039, Iw=0.034), indicating a Wright's neighborhood size of about 100 individuals. For C. tepejilote, nonrandom genetic distribution among nearest neighbors was detected, even from small spatial autocorrelation values (Iu=0.008, Iw=0.009), consistent with a neighborhood size of about 300 individuals. For both species, seed dispersal, mortality among life cycle stages, overlapping generations, and contrasting traits of mating and reproduction influence the standing spatial genetic structure within populations.},

It is shown that a linked cline induces a step in the frequency of a neutral allele, which is proportional to the gradient in neutral allele frequency and to the inverse of the recombination rate. A barrier to dispersal or a local region of low abundance has a similar effect (Nagylaki, 1976). The cline will block the flow of neutral alleles over a region of chromosome roughly 2 sqrt s/t map units long. However, a slightly advantageous allele will be little affected, and must be very tightly linked to be delayed for long.},

@article{funk-nosil-egan,
  abstract = {Genetic differentiation can be highly variable across the genome. For example, loci under divergent selection and those tightly linked to them may exhibit elevated differentiation compared to neutral regions. These represent "outlier loci" whose differentiation exceeds neutral expectations. Adaptive divergence can also increase genome-wide differentiation by promoting general barriers to neutral gene flow, thereby facilitating genomic divergence via genetic drift. This latter process can yield a positive correlation between adaptive phenotypic divergence and neutral genetic differentiation (described here as "isolation-by-adaptation"). Here, we examine both these processes by combining an AFLP genome scan of two host plant ecotypes of Timema cristinae walking-sticks with existing data on adaptive phenotypic divergence and ecological speciation in these insects. We found that about 8% of loci are outliers in multiple population comparisons. Replicated comparisons between population-pairs using the same versus different host species revealed that 1–2% of loci are subject to host-related selection specifically. Locus-specific analyses revealed that up to 10% of putatively neutral (nonoutlier) AFLP loci exhibit significant isolation-by-adaptation. Our results suggest that selection may affect differentiation directly, via linkage, or by facilitating genetic drift. They thus illustrate the varied and sometimes nonintuitive contributions of selection to heterogeneous genomic differentiation.},

@article{BryanK._Epperson06011999,
  abstract = {Population genetics theory has dealt only with the spatial or geographic pattern of degrees of relatedness or genetic similarity separately for each point in time. However, a frequent goal of experimental studies is to infer migration patterns that occurred in the past or over extended periods of time. To fully understand how a present geographic pattern of genetic variation reflects one in the past, it is necessary to build genealogy models that directly relate the two. For the first time, space-time probabilities of identity by descent and coalescence probabilities are formulated and characterized in this article. Formulations for general migration processes are developed and applied to specific types of systems. The results can be used to determine the level of certainty that genes found in present populations are descended from ancient genes in the same population or nearby populations vs. geographically distant populations. Some parameter combinations result in past populations that are quite distant geographically being essentially as likely to contain ancestors of genes at a given population as the past population located at the same place. This has implications for the geographic point of origin of ancestral, "Eve," genes. The results also form the first model for emerging "space-time" molecular genetic data.

  abstract = {We introduce a general recursion for the probability of identity in state of two individuals sampled from a population subject to mutation, migration, and random drift in a two-dimensional continuum. The recursion allows for the interactions induced by density-dependent regulation of the population, which are inevitable in a continuous population. We give explicit series expansions for large neighbourhood size and for low mutation rates respectively and investigate the accuracy of the classical Malécot formula for these general models. When neighbourhood size is small, this formula does not give the identity even over large scales. However, for large neighbourhood size, it is an accurate approximation which summarises the local population structure in terms of three quantities: the effective dispersal rate, σe; the effective population density, ρe; and a local scale, κ, at which local interactions become significant. The results are illustrated by simulations.

@article{rabies-spread,
  abstract = {Infectious disease emergence is under the simultaneous influence
of both genetic and ecological factors. Yet, we lack a general
framework for linking ecological dynamics of infectious disease
with underlying molecular and evolutionary change. As a model,
we illustrate the linkage between ecological and evolutionary
dynamics in rabies virus during its epidemic expansion into eastern
and southern Ontario. We characterized the phylogeographic re-
lationships among 83 isolates of fox rabies virus variant using
nucleotide sequences from the glycoprotein-encoding glycopro-
tein gene. The fox rabies virus variant descended as an irregular
wave with two arms invading from northern Ontario into southern
Ontario over the 1980s and 1990s. Correlations between genetic
and geographic distance suggest an isolation by distance popula-
tion structure for the virus. The divergence among viral lineages
since the most recent common ancestor correlates with position
along the advancing wave front with more divergent lineages near
the origin of the epidemic. Based on divergence from the most
recent common ancestor, the regional population can be parti-
tioned into two subpopulations, each corresponding to an arm of
the advancing wave. Subpopulation A (southern Ontario) showed
reduced isolation by distance relative to subpopulation B (eastern
Ontario). The temporal dynamics of subpopulation A suggests that
the subregional viral population may have undergone several
smaller waves that reduced isolation by distance. The use of
integrated approaches, such as the geographical analysis of se-
quence variants, coupled with information on spatial dynamics will
become indispensable aids in understanding patterns of disease
emergence.

@article{epperson-multilocus,
  abstract = {   Spatial structure of genetic variation within populations is well measured by statistics based on the distribution of pairs of
individual genotypes, and various such statistics have been widely used in experimental studies. However, the problem of
uncharacterized correlations among statistics for different alleles has limited the applications of multiallelic, multilocus summary
measures, since these had unknown sampling distributions. Usually multiple alleles and/or multiple loci are required in order to
precisely measure spatial structures, and to provide precise indirect estimates of the amount of dispersal in samples of reasonable
size. This article examines the correlations among pair-wise statistics, including Moran I-statistics and various measures of
conditional kinship, for different alleles of a locus. First the correlations are mathematically derived for random spatial
distributions, which allow averages over alleles and loci to be used as more powerful yet exact test statistics for the null hypothesis.
Then extensive computer simulations are conducted to examine the correlations among values for different alleles under isolation by
distance processes. For loci with more than three alleles, the results show that the correlations are remarkably and perhaps
surprisingly small, establishing the principle that then alleles behave as nearly independent realizations of space­time stochastic
processes. The results also show that the correlations are largely robust with respect to the degree of spatial structure, and they can
be used in a straightforward manner to form confidence intervals for averages. The results allow a precise connection between
observations in experimental studies and levels of dispersal in theoretical models.

The spatial correlations at the shortest distances are particularly robust to range of conditions and have disproportionately high statistical power. This review integrates theoretical results in a way that maximizes robustness and flexibility in the use of short distance autocorrelation to estimate Wright's neighborhood size, or the total variance in dispersal distances. Empirical guidelines are developed that are meant to be as practical and broad as possible.

@article{barton1979dynamics,
  abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamic behaviour of hybrid zones which are maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids. In the first section it is shown that a hybrid zone involving a single locus can move in response to a selective imbalance between the two homozygotes, and also to variation in population density and dispersal rate. It can be trapped by natural barriers, and so an allele which is selected against when rare cannot advance, even if it is advantageous when common. The continuous model used in deriving these results is shown to be a good approximation to the stepping-stone model, provided that the cline contains several demes.

The effect of stochastic forces on multi-locus hybrid zones is then considered. An expression giving the shift in position after an arbitrary perturbation in gamete frequency is derived. Using this formula, it is found that sampling drift is negligible unless the zone includes few organisms and involves few loci. Random variations in population structure are the dominant force, and could allow considerable movement in an even environment. However, natural barriers can still trap hybrid zones, and so it is likely that they will remain roughly where they first formed.},

Introduction
The purpose o f th e present paper is to investigate a n interacting system de-
scribing an evolution of gene frequencies in population genetics. In particular, we
are interested in the effect of geographical structure in the process of evolution.
We shall first explain our interacting system. Let S be a countable set. Each
element i of S is called " a c o lo n y ". W e assume that there are two alleles A and
B at each colony and denote by x (1—x ) the gene frequency of the A-allele (resp.
the B-allele) for the colony i e S . A time evolution of gene frequencies is caused by
the following three factors;
(1) mutation in each colony,
(2) migration among colonies, and
( 3 ) random sampling drift.
It is described by means of the following stochastic differential equation,},

  abstract = { Abstract: Consider a system of coalescing random walks where each individual performs a random walk over a finite graph $ \mathbf {G}$ or (more generally) evolves according to some reversible Markov chain generator $ Q$. Let $ C$ be the first time at which all walkers have coalesced into a single cluster. $ C$ is closely related to the consensus time of the voter model for this $ \mathbf {G}$ or $ Q$.

We prove that the expected value of $ C$ is at most a constant multiple of the largest hitting time of an element in the state space. This solves a problem posed by Aldous and Fill and gives sharp bounds in many examples, including all vertex-transitive graphs. We also obtain results on the expected time until only $ k\geq 2$ clusters remain. Our proof tools include a new exponential inequality for the meeting time of a reversible Markov chain and a deterministic trajectory, which we believe to be of independent interest. },

However, if there is population structure and the sample is drawn from a single subpopulation, these two estimates of theta behave differently. The expected number of alleles in a sample is an increasing function of the migration rates, whereas the expected average number of nucleotide differences is shown to be independent of the migration rates and equal to 4N(T)micro for a general model of population structure which includes both the island model and the circular stepping-stone model. This contrast in the behavior of these two estimates of theta is used as the basis of a test for population subdivision. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation developed so that independent samples from a single subpopulation could be obtained quickly, this test is shown to be a useful method to determine if there is population subdivision.},

is typically represented by a network of nodes and resistors, with the resistance between nodes a function of landscape characteristics.
The effective distance between two locations on a landscape is represented by the resistance distance between the nodes in the network.
Circuit theory has been applied to many other scientific fields for exploratory analyses, but parametric models for circuits are not common
in the scientific literature. To model circuits explicitly, we demonstrate a link between Gaussian Markov random fields and contemporary
circuit theory using a covariance structure that induces the necessary resistance distance. This provides a parametric model for second-order
observations from such a system. In the landscape ecology setting, the proposed model provides a simple framework where inference can be
obtained for effects that landscape features have on functional connectivity. We illustrate the approach through a landscape genetics study
linking gene flow in alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) to the underlying landscape.},

However, determining which habitats should be set aside to promote connectivity has been difficult because existing models cannot incorporate effects of multiple pathways linking populations. Here, we test an ecological connectivity model that overcomes this obstacle by borrowing from electrical circuit theory. The model vastly improves gene flow predictions because it simultaneously integrates all possible pathways connecting populations. When applied to data from threatened mammal and tree species, the model consistently outperformed conventional gene flow models, revealing that barriers were less important in structuring populations than previously thought. Circuit theory now provides the best-justified method to bridge landscape and genetic data, and holds much promise in ecology, evolution, and conservation planning.},

  abstract = {Predicting population-level effects of landscape change depends on identifying factors that influence population connectivity in complex landscapes. However, most putative movement corridors and barriers have not been based on empirical data. In this study, we identify factors that influence connectivity by comparing patterns of genetic similarity among 146 black bears (Ursus americanus), sampled across a 3,000-km(2) study area in northern Idaho, with 110 landscape-resistance hypotheses. Genetic similarities were based on the pairwise percentage dissimilarity among all individuals based on nine microsatellite loci (average expected heterozygosity=0.79). Landscape-resistance hypotheses describe a range of potential relationships between movement cost and land cover, slope, elevation, roads, Euclidean distance, and a putative movement barrier. These hypotheses were divided into seven organizational models in which the influences of barriers, distance, and landscape features were statistically separated using partial Mantel tests. Only one of the competing organizational models was fully supported: patterns of genetic structure are primarily related to landscape gradients of land cover and elevation. The alternative landscape models, isolation by barriers and isolation by distance, are not supported. In this black bear population, gene flow is facilitated by contiguous forest cover at middle elevations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Landscape resistance reflects how difficult it is for genes to move across an area with particular attributes (e.g. land cover, slope). An increasingly popular approach to estimate resistance uses Mantel and partial Mantel tests or causal modelling to relate observed genetic distances to effective distances under alternative sets of resistance parameters. Relatively few alternative sets of resistance parameters are tested, leading to relatively poor coverage of the parameter space. Although this approach does not explicitly model key stochastic processes of gene flow, including mating, dispersal, drift and inheritance, bias and precision of the resulting resistance parameters have not been assessed. We formally describe the most commonly used model as a set of equations and provide a formal approach for estimating resistance parameters. Our optimization finds the maximum Mantel r when an optimum exists and identifies the same resistance values as current approaches when the alternatives evaluated are near the optimum. Unfortunately, even where an optimum existed, estimates from the most commonly used model were imprecise and were typically much smaller than the simulated true resistance to dispersal. Causal modelling using Mantel significance tests also typically failed to support the true resistance to dispersal values. For a large range of scenarios, current approaches using a simple correlational model between genetic and effective distances do not yield accurate estimates of resistance to dispersal. We suggest that analysts consider the processes important to gene flow for their study species, model those processes explicitly and evaluate the quality of estimates resulting from their model.},

The field of landscape genetics provides valuable approaches to study dispersal indirectly, which in turn may be used to understand patterns of disease spread. Here, we applied landscape genetic analyses and spatially explicit models to identify the potential path of raccoon rabies spread in a mesocarnivore community. We used relatedness estimates derived from microsatellite genotypes of raccoons and striped skunks to investigate their dispersal patterns in a heterogeneous landscape composed predominantly of agricultural, forested and residential areas. Samples were collected in an area covering 22 000 km(2) in southern Qu\{\'e\}bec, where the raccoon rabies variant (RRV) was first detected in 2006. Multiple regressions on distance matrices revealed that genetic distance among male raccoons was strictly a function of geographic distance, while dispersal in female raccoons was significantly reduced by the presence of agricultural fields. In skunks, our results suggested that dispersal is increased in edge habitats between fields and forest fragments in both males and females. Resistance modelling allowed us to identify likely dispersal corridors used by these two rabies hosts, which may prove especially helpful for surveillance and control (e.g. oral vaccination) activities. },

However, it is often unclear whether divergence is due simply to separation or whether populations have also experienced gene flow. These questions can be addressed with a full model of population separation with gene flow, by applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for estimating the posterior probability distribution of model parameters. We have generalized this method and made it applicable to data from multiple unlinked loci. These loci can vary in their modes of inheritance, and inheritance scalars can be implemented either as constants or as parameters to be estimated. By treating inheritance scalars as parameters it is also possible to address variation among loci in the impact via linkage of recurrent selective sweeps or background selection. These methods are applied to a large multilocus data set from Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. The species are estimated to have diverged approximately 500,000 years ago. Several loci have nonzero estimates of gene flow since the initial separation of the species, with considerable variation in gene flow estimates among loci, in both directions between the species.},

  abstract = {In 1988, Felsenstein described a framework for assessing the likelihood of a genetic data set in which all of the possible genealogical histories of the data are considered, each in proportion to their probability. Although not analytically solvable, several approaches, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, have been developed to find approximate solutions. Here, we describe an approach in which Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations are used to integrate over the space of genealogies, whereas other parameters are integrated out analytically. The result is an approximation to the full joint posterior density of the model parameters. For many purposes, this function can be treated as a likelihood, thereby permitting likelihood-based analyses, including likelihood ratio tests of nested models. Several examples, including an application to the divergence of chimpanzee subspecies, are provided.},

@article{beerli2010unified,
  abstract = {For many biological investigations, groups of individuals are genetically sampled from several geographic locations. These sampling locations often do not reflect the genetic population structure. We describe a framework using marginal likelihoods to compare and order structured population models, such as testing whether the sampling locations belong to the same randomly mating population or comparing unidirectional and multidirectional gene flow models. In the context of inferences employing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the accuracy of the marginal likelihoods depends heavily on the approximation method used to calculate the marginal likelihood. Two methods, modified thermodynamic integration and a stabilized harmonic mean estimator, are compared. With finite Markov chain Monte Carlo run lengths, the harmonic mean estimator may not be consistent. Thermodynamic integration, in contrast, delivers considerably better estimates of the marginal likelihood. The choice of prior distributions does not influence the order and choice of the better models when the marginal likelihood is estimated using thermodynamic integration, whereas with the harmonic mean estimator the influence of the prior is pronounced and the order of the models changes. The approximation of marginal likelihood using thermodynamic integration in MIGRATE allows the evaluation of complex population genetic models, not only of whether sampling locations belong to a single panmictic population, but also of competing complex structured population models.},

Summarizing over loci can be done by assuming either that the mutation rate is the same for all loci or that the mutation rates are gamma distributed among loci but the same for all sites of a locus.

To that aim, I first provide results for values of F-statistics in one-dimensional models and coalescence times in two-dimensional models, and make more precise earlier results for F-statistics in two-dimensional models and coalescence times in one-dimensional models. Based on these results, I propose a method of data analysis involving the regression of FST/(1-FST) estimates for pairs of subpopulations on geographic distance for populations along linear habitats or logarithm of distance for populations in two-dimensional habitats. This regression provides in principle an estimate of the product of population density and second moment of parental axial distance. In two cases where comparison to direct estimates is possible, the method proposed here is more satisfactory than previous indirect methods.},

At a demographic equilibrium, Ne can be derived from the demography by combining information about the ultimate contribution of each deme to the future genetic make-up of the population and Wright's FST's. This formula is applied to a catastrophic extinction model (where sites are either empty or at carrying capacity) and to a metapopulation model with explicit dynamics, where extinction is caused by demographic stochasticity and by chaos. Contrary to the expectation from the standard island model, the usual effect of population subdivision is to decrease the effective size relative to a panmictic population living on the same resource.},

@article{sundqvist2016directional,
  abstract = {Understanding the population structure and patterns of gene flow within species is of fundamental importance to the study of evolution. In the fields of population and evolutionary genetics, measures of genetic differentiation are commonly used to gather this information. One potential caveat is that these measures assume gene flow to be symmetric. However, asymmetric gene flow is common in nature, especially in systems driven by physical processes such as wind or water currents. As information about levels of asymmetric gene flow among populations is essential for the correct interpretation of the distribution of contemporary genetic diversity within species, this should not be overlooked. To obtain information on asymmetric migration patterns from genetic data, complex models based on maximum-likelihood or Bayesian approaches generally need to be employed, often at great computational cost. Here, a new simpler and more efficient approach for understanding gene flow patterns is presented. This approach allows the estimation of directional components of genetic divergence between pairs of populations at low computational effort, using any of the classical or modern measures of genetic differentiation. These directional measures of genetic differentiation can further be used to calculate directional relative migration and to detect asymmetries in gene flow patterns. This can be done in a user-friendly web application called divMigrate-online introduced in this study. Using simulated data sets with known gene flow regimes, we demonstrate that the method is capable of resolving complex migration patterns under a range of study designs.},

@article{waples2009modelling,
  abstract = {Abstract Evolutionary processes are routinely modelled using ‘ideal’ Wright–Fisher populations of constant size N in which each individual has an equal expectation of reproductive success. In a hypothetical ideal population, variance in reproductive success (Vk) is binomial and effective population size (Ne) = N. However, in any actual implementation of the Wright–Fisher model (e.g., in a computer), Vk is a random variable and its realized value in any given replicate generation () only rarely equals the binomial variance. Realized effective size () thus also varies randomly in modelled ideal populations, and the consequences of this have not been adequately explored in the literature. Analytical and numerical results show that random variation in  and  can seriously distort analyses that evaluate precision or otherwise depend on the assumption that  is constant. We derive analytical expressions for Var(Vk) [4(2N – 1)(N – 1)/N3] and Var(Ne) [N(N – 1)/(2N – 1) ≈ N/2] in modelled ideal populations and show that, for a genetic metric G = f(Ne), Var(Ĝ) has two components: VarGene (due to variance across replicate samples of genes, given a specific ) and VarDemo (due to variance in ). Var(Ĝ) is higher than it would be with constant Ne = N, as implicitly assumed by many standard models. We illustrate this with empirical examples based on F (standardized variance of allele frequency) and r2 (a measure of linkage disequilibrium). Results demonstrate that in computer models that track multilocus genotypes, methods of replication and data analysis can strongly affect consequences of variation in . These effects are more important when sampling error is small (large numbers of individuals, loci and alleles) and with relatively small populations (frequently modelled by those interested in conservation).},

Specifically, the way random models of reproduction are used in coalescent theory is not justified. Instead, the population pedigree for diploid organisms--that is, the set of all family relationships among members of the population--although unknown, should be treated as a fixed parameter, not as a random quantity. Gene genealogical models should describe the outcome of the percolation of genetic lineages through the population pedigree according to Mendelian inheritance. Using simulated pedigrees, some of which are based on family data from 19th century Sweden, we show that in many cases the (conceptually wrong) standard coalescent model is difficult to reject statistically and in this sense may provide a surprisingly accurate description of gene genealogies on a fixed pedigree. We study the differences between the fixed-pedigree coalescent and the standard coalescent by analysis and simulations. Differences are apparent in recent past, within ≈ <log(2)(N) generations, but then disappear as genetic lineages are traced into the more distant past.},

as a nuisance parameter, the unobserved product of a past history of random
mating. However, the history of genetic relationships in a given population is
a fixed, unobserved object, and so an alternative approach is to treat this

observing how genomes have been noisily passed down through it. This paper
explores this point of view, showing how to translate questions about
population genetic data into calculations with a Poisson process of mutations
on all ancestral genomes. This method is applied to give a robust
interpretation to the $f_4$ statistic used to identify admixture, and to design
a new statistic that measures covariances in mean times to most recent common
ancestor between two pairs of sequences. The method more generally interprets
population genetic statistics in terms of sums of specific functions over
ancestral genomes, thereby providing concrete, broadly interpretable
interpretations for these statistics. This provides a method for describing
demographic history without simplified demographic models. More generally, it
brings into focus the population pedigree, which is averaged over in

They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},

  abstract = {In many species a fundamental feature of genetic diversity is that genetic similarity decays with geographic distance; however, this relationship is often complex, and may vary across space and time. Methods to uncover and visualize such relationships have widespread use for analyses in molecular ecology, conservation genetics, evolutionary genetics, and human genetics. While several frameworks exist, a promising approach is to infer maps of how migration rates vary across geographic space. Such maps could, in principle, be estimated across time to reveal the full complexity of population histories. Here, we take a step in this direction: we present a method to infer separate maps of population sizes and migration rates for different time periods from a matrix of genetic similarity between every pair of individuals. Specifically, genetic similarity is measured by counting the number of long segments of haplotype sharing (also known as identity-by-descent tracts). By varying the length of these segments we obtain parameter estimates for qualitatively different time periods. Using simulations, we show that the method can reveal time-varying migration rates and population sizes, including changes that are not detectable when ignoring haplotypic structure. We apply the method to a dataset of contemporary European individuals (POPRES), and provide an integrated analysis of recent population structure and growth over the last ~3,000 years in Europe.

  abstract = {Segments of indentity-by-descent (IBD) detected from high-density genetic data are useful for many applications, including long-range phase determination, phasing family data, imputation, IBD mapping, and heritability analysis in founder populations. We present Refined IBD, a new method for IBD segment detection. Refined IBD achieves both computational efficiency and highly accurate IBD segment reporting by searching for IBD in two steps. The first step (identification) uses the GERMLINE algorithm to find shared haplotypes exceeding a length threshold. The second step (refinement) evaluates candidate segments with a probabilistic approach to assess the evidence for IBD. Like GERMLINE, Refined IBD allows for IBD reporting on a haplotype level, which facilitates determination of multi-individual IBD and allows for haplotype-based downstream analyses. To investigate the properties of Refined IBD, we simulate SNP data from a model with recent superexponential population growth that is designed to match United Kingdom data. The simulation results show that Refined IBD achieves a better power/accuracy profile than fastIBD or GERMLINE.

We also apply Refined IBD to SNP data for samples from the United Kingdom and from Northern Finland and describe the IBD sharing in these data sets.

  abstract = {Existing methods for estimating historical effective population size from genetic data have been unable to accurately estimate effective population size during the most recent past. We present a non-parametric method for accurately estimating recent effective population size by using inferred long segments of identity by descent (IBD). We found that inferred segments of IBD contain information about effective population size from around 4 generations to around 50 generations ago for SNP array data and to over 200 generations ago for sequence data. In human populations that we examined, the estimates of effective size were approximately one-third of the census size. We estimate the effective population size of European-ancestry individuals in the UK four generations ago to be eight million and the effective population size of Finland four generations ago to be 0.7 million. Our method is implemented in the open-source IBDNe software package. },

  abstract = {Dendritic landscapes can have ecological properties that differ importantly from simpler spatial arrangements of habitats. Most dendritic landscapes are structured by elevation, and therefore, migration is likely to be directionally biased. While the population-genetic consequences of both dendritic landscape arrangements and asymmetric migration have begun to be studied, these processes have not been considered together. Simple conceptual models predict that if migration into branch (headwater) populations is limited, such populations can act as reservoirs for potentially unique alleles. As a consequence of the fact that dendritic landscapes have, by definition, more branches than internal habitat patches, this process may lead to the maintenance of higher overall genetic diversities in metapopulations inhabiting dendritic networks where migration is directionally biased. Here we begin to address the generality of these simple predictions using genetic models and a review of empirical literature. We show, for a range of demographic parameters, that dendritic systems with asymmetric migration can maintain levels of genetic variation that are very different, sometimes very elevated, compared with more classical models of geographical population structure. Furthermore, predicted patterns of genetic variation within metapopulations--that is, stepwise increases in genetic diversity at nodes--do occur in some empirical data.},

@article{gaines2003avoiding,
  abstract = {The pun in the above title reflects two points. First, marine life cycles commonly include a dispersive juvenile stage that is moved about by ocean currents. This stage often is the predominant, or only, means of dispersal that connects spatially disjunct populations. As a consequence, details of dispersal likely play a critical role in determining the effectiveness of marine reserves as a management and conservation tool. Curiously, however (and this is the second point of the title), although dozens of models for marine reserves now exist, few actually account explicitly for larval dispersal. Moreover, those that do include dispersal, do so almost exclusively by considering it to be a nondirectional spreading process (diffusion), ignoring the effects of directional transport by currents (advection). Here we develop a population dynamical model for marine organisms with relatively sedentary adults whose larvae are transported in a simple flow field with both diffusive spreading and directional characteristics. We find that advection can play a dominant role in determining the effectiveness of different reserve configurations. Two of the most important consequences are: (1) with strong currents, multiple reserves can be markedly more effective than single reserves of equivalent total size; and (2) in the presence of strong currents, reserves can significantly outperform traditional, effort-based management strategies in terms of fisheries yield, and do so with less risk. These results suggest that successful reserve design may require considerable new efforts to examine explicitly the role of dispersal of young.},

Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.},

@article{cayuelademographic,
  abstract = {Abstract Dispersal is a central process in ecology and evolution. At the individual level, the three stages of the dispersal process (i.e., emigration, transience and immigration) are affected by complex interactions between phenotypes and environmental factors. Condition- and context-dependent dispersal have far-reaching consequences, both for the demography and the genetic structuring of natural populations and for adaptive processes. From an applied point of view, dispersal also deeply affects the spatial dynamics of populations and their ability to respond to land-use changes, habitat degradation and climate change. For these reasons, dispersal has received considerable attention from ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Demographic and genetic methods allow quantifying non-effective (i.e., followed or not by a successful reproduction) and effective (i.e., with a successful reproduction) dispersal and to investigate how individual and environmental factors affect the different stages of the dispersal process. Over the past decade, demographic and genetic methods designed to quantify dispersal have rapidly evolved but interactions between researchers from the two fields are limited. We here review recent developments in both demographic and genetic methods to study dispersal in wild animal populations. We present their strengths and limits, as well as their applicability depending on study objectives and population characteristics. We propose a unified framework allowing researchers to combine methods and select the more suitable tools to address a broad range of important topics about the ecology and evolution of dispersal and its consequences on animal population dynamics and genetics.},

Here we predict conditions that lead to nonequilibrium geographic distributions of mtDNA lineages, test the robustness of these predictions and examine mtDNA data sets for consistency with our model. Under a simple isolation by distance model, the variance of an mtDNA lineage's geographic distribution is expected be proportional to its age. Simulation results indicated that this relationship is fairly robust. Analysis of mtDNA data from natural populations revealed three qualitative distributional patterns: (1) significant departure of lineage structure from equilibrium geographic distributions, a pattern exhibited in three rodent species with limited dispersal; (2) nonsignificant departure from equilibrium expectations, exhibited by two avian and two marine fish species with potentials for relatively long-distance dispersal; and (3) a progression from nonequilibrium distributions for younger lineages to equilibrium distributions for older lineages, a condition displayed by one surveyed avian species. These results demonstrate the advantages of considering mutation and genealogy in the interpretation of mtDNA geographic variation.},

These identity-by-descent (IBD) blocks are direct traces of recent coalescence events and, as such, contain ample signal to infer recent demography. Here, we examine sharing of such blocks in two-dimensional populations with local migration. Using a diffusion approximation to trace genetic ancestry, we derive analytical formulas for patterns of isolation by distance of IBD blocks, which can also incorporate recent population density changes. We introduce an inference scheme that uses a composite-likelihood approach to fit these formulas. We then extensively evaluate our theory and inference method on a range of scenarios using simulated data. We first validate the diffusion approximation by showing that the theoretical results closely match the simulated block-sharing patterns. We then demonstrate that our inference scheme can accurately and robustly infer dispersal rate and effective density, as well as bounds on recent dynamics of population density. To demonstrate an application, we use our estimation scheme to explore the fit of a diffusion model to Eastern European samples in the Population Reference Sample data set. We show that ancestry diffusing with a rate of [Formula: see text] during the last centuries, combined with accelerating population growth, can explain the observed exponential decay of block sharing with increasing pairwise sample distance.},

A barrier to gene flow distorts this classical pattern of isolation by distance.

Here, we introduce an inference scheme that uses this signal to detect and estimate the strength of a linear barrier to gene flow in two dimensions. We use a diffusion approximation to model the effects of a barrier on the geographic spread of ancestry backward in time. This approach allows us to calculate the chance of recent coalescence and probability of identity by descent. We introduce an inference scheme that fits these theoretical results to the geographic covariance structure of bialleleic genetic markers. It can estimate the strength of the barrier as well as several demographic parameters. We investigate the power of our inference scheme to detect barriers by applying it to a wide range of simulated data.

When demographic models take into account this habitat heterogeneity, the source-sink concept naturally emerges: a local demographic surplus arises in good quality habitats (source), and a local demographic deficit occurs in habitats of poor quality (sink). Within a landscape, a permanent migration of propagules or individuals from source to sink habitats may lead to a stabilization of the overall demographic system. This simple situation, explored in the recent literature, has surprising properties. In particular, it requires a change in our view of classical concepts such as ecological niche and carrying capacity, it can explain the existence and persistence of local maladaptation and it can improve conservation practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Although habitat loss, fragmentation, and invasive species collectively pose the greatest threats to biodiversity, little theoretical or empirical research has addressed the effects of landscape structure—or spatial pattern more generally—on the spread of invasive species. Landscape ecology is the study of how spatial pattern affects ecological process. Thus, a landscape ecology of invasive spread involves understanding how spatial pattern, such as habitat fragmentation or resource distributions, affects the various stages of the invasion process. Landscape structure may affect the spread of invasive species and the invasibility of communities by (1) enhancing spread above some threshold level of landscape disturbance directly, or indirectly through landscape effects on dispersal vectors; (2) affecting the various stages of the invasion process (e.g., dispersal vs. population growth) in different, potentially contrasting, ways; (3) interacting with the distribution of invasive species to facilitate spread (e.g., nascent foci); (4) promoting or altering species interactions in ways that enhance the invasibility of communities (e.g., edge effects); (5) compromising the adaptive potential of native species to resist invasion, or—alternatively—enhancing the adaptive response of invasive species, in fragmented landscapes; and (6) interacting with the dynamics of the disturbance architecture to create spatiotemporal fluctuations in resource availability, which enhance system invasibility. Understanding the landscape ecology of invasive spread may thus afford new insights and opportunities for managing and restoring landscapes so as to control the spread of invasive species and minimize the invasibility of communities.},

@article{shaffer2017desert,
  abstract = {The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) provided research funds to study the conservation genomics and landscape genomics of the Mojave desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizii, in response to the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP). To do this, we consolidated tissue samples of the desert tortoise from across the species range within California and southern Nevada, generated a DNA dataset consisting of full genomes of 270 tortoises, and analyzed the way in which the environment of the desert tortoise has determined modern patterns of relatedness and genetic diversity across the landscape. Here we present the implications of these results for the conservation and landscape genomics of the desert tortoise. Our work strongly indicates that several well-defined genetic groups exist within the species, including a primary north-south genetic discontinuity at the Ivanpah Valley and another separating western from eastern Mojave samples. We also use existing desert tortoise habitat modeling data with a novel extension of genetic "resistance distance" using geographic maps of continuous space to predict the relative impacts of five proposed development alternatives within the DRECP and rank them with respect to their likely impacts on desert tortoise gene flow and connectivity in the Mojave. Finally, we analyzed the impacts of each of the 214 distinct proposed development area "chunks", derived from the proposed development polygons, and ranked each chunk in terms of its range-wide impacts on desert tortoise gene flow.},

  abstract = { Inverting the Laplace transform is a paradigm for exponentially ill-posed problems. For a
 class of operators, including the Laplace transform, we give forward and inverse formulae
 that have fast implementations using the fast Fourier transform. These formulae lead easily
 to regularized inverses whose effects on noise and filtered data can be precisely described.
 Our results give cogent reasons for the general sense of dread most mathematicians feel
 about inverting the Laplace transform.

Introduction:      1. Introduction. Inversion of the Laplace transform is the paradigmatic exponen-
tially ill-posed problem. In many inverse scattering problems, the Laplace transform
is, at least implicitly, a part of the forward model, and so the solution of the inverse
scattering problem entails inverting the Laplace transform; see [12, 13, 9, 6]. While
it is well understood that this inversion is problematic, to the best of our knowledge,
no one has yet spelled out the details of why, where, and how things go wrong. In
this note we introduce the harmonic analysis appropriate to this problem. On one
hand, this leads to fast numerical forward and inverse algorithms for data which is
log-uniformly sampled. On the other hand, we apply it to study regularized inverses
of the Laplace transform. We analyze the consequences of passing noisy, filtered mea-
surements through the approximate inverse. The picture that emerges is probably
much worse than most people imagine.

@article{terhorst2015fundamental,
  abstract = {The sample frequency spectrum (SFS) of DNA sequences from a collection of individuals is a summary statistic that is commonly used for parametric inference in population genetics. Despite the popularity of SFS-based inference methods, little is currently known about the information theoretic limit on the estimation accuracy as a function of sample size. Here, we show that using the SFS to estimate the size history of a population has a minimax error of at least O(1/log s), where s is the number of independent segregating sites used in the analysis. This rate is exponentially worse than known convergence rates for many classical estimation problems in statistics. Another surprising aspect of our theoretical bound is that it does not depend on the dimension of the SFS, which is related to the number of sampled individuals. This means that, for a fixed number s of segregating sites considered, using more individuals does not help to reduce the minimax error bound. Our result pertains to populations that have experienced a bottleneck, and we argue that it can be expected to apply to many populations in nature. },

@article{haller2018treesequence,
  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for evolutionary models to incorporate relatively realistic dynamics, ranging from selection at many genomic sites to complex demography, population structure, and ecological interactions. Such models can generally be implemented as individual-based forward simulations, but the large computational overhead of these models often makes simulation of whole chromosome sequences in large populations infeasible. This situation presents an important obstacle to the field that requires conceptual advances to overcome. The recently developed tree-sequence recording method (Kelleher et al., 2018), which stores the genealogical history of all genomes in the simulated population, could provide such an advance. This method has several benefits: (1) it allows neutral mutations to be omitted entirely from forward-time simulations and added later, thereby dramatically improving computational efficiency; (2) it allows neutral burn-in to be constructed extremely efficiently after the fact, using "recapitation"; (3) it allows direct examination and analysis of the genealogical trees along the genome; and (4) it provides a compact representation of a population{\textquoteright}s genealogy that can be analyzed in Python using the msprime package. We have implemented the tree-sequence recording method in SLiM 3 (a free, open-source evolutionary simulation software package) and extended it to allow the recording of non-neutral mutations, greatly broadening the utility of this method. To demonstrate the versatility and performance of this approach, we showcase several practical applications that would have been beyond the reach of previously existing methods, opening up new horizons for the modeling and exploration of evolutionary processes.},

@article{haller2018forward,
  abstract = {With the desire to model population genetic processes under increasingly realistic scenarios, forward genetic simulations have become a critical part of the toolbox of modern evolutionary biology. The SLiM forward genetic simulation framework is one of the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However, its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult to adapt the Wright-Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space, overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction, density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization, mating between subpopulations, age structure, fitness-based survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth. In response to this need, we here introduce SLiM 3, which contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these limitations. First, the new non-Wright-Fisher or "nonWF" model type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more. Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables. We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and present several example models to illustrate their use. These two key features allow SLiM 3 models to go beyond the Wright-Fisher model, opening up new horizons for forward genetic modeling.},

@article{kelleher2018efficient,
  abstract = {In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire genetic history of a population in forwards-time, individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary breeding models, population structure and demography. This approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly {\textquoteright}simplify{\textquoteright} a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the extant population, we show that the total storage space required is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large, whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a simulation{\textquoteright}s entire final generation as well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for recording and processing tree sequences is named tskit.},

We use forward computer simulations of population growth, migration, and mutation in an analysis of an expanding population with a wave front that advances at a constant slow rate. A pronounced founder effect can be observed among mutations arising in this wave front where extreme population bottlenecks arise and are followed by major population growth. A fraction of mutations travel with the wave front and generate mutant populations that are on average much larger than those that remain stationary. Analysis of the diffusion of these mutants makes it possible to reconstruct migratory trajectories during population expansions, thus helping us better understand observed patterns in the evolution of species such as modern humans. Examination of some historical data supports our model.},

@article{hallatschek2010life,
  abstract = {Environmental changes have caused episodes of habitat expansions in the evolutionary history of many species. These range changes affect the dynamics of biological evolution in multiple ways. Recent microbial experiments as well as simulations suggest that enhanced genetic drift at the frontier of a two-dimensional range expansion can cause genetic sectoring patterns with fractal domain boundaries. Here, we propose and analyze a simple model of asexual biological evolution at expanding frontiers that explains these neutral patterns and predicts the effect of natural selection. We find that beneficial mutations give rise to sectors with an opening angle that depends sensitively on the selective advantage of the mutants. Deleterious mutations, on the other hand, are not able to establish a sector permanently. They can, however, temporarily "surf" on the population front, and thereby reach unusually high frequencies. As a consequence, expanding frontiers are loaded with a high fraction of mutants at mutation-selection balance. Numerically, we also determine the condition at which the wild type is lost in favor of deleterious mutants (genetic meltdown) at a growing front. Our prediction for this error threshold differs qualitatively from existing well-mixed theories, and sets tight constraints on sustainable mutation rates for populations that undergo frequent range expansions.},

@article{ashander2018demographic,
  abstract = {In this paper, we study the general problem of extracting information from spatially explicit genomic data to inform inference of ecologically and geographically realistic population models. We describe methods and apply them to simulations motivated by the demography of the Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii). The tortoise is an example of a long-lived, threatened species for which we have an excellent understanding of range, habitat preference, and certain aspects of demography, but inadequate information on other life history components that are important for conservation management. We use an individual-based model on a discretized geographic landscape with overlapping generations and age and sex-specific dispersal, fecundity, and mortality to develop and test a method that uses genomic data to infer demographic parameters. We do this by seeking parameters that best match a set of spatial statistics of genomes, which we introduce and discuss. We find that for inferring only overall population density and mean migration distance, a simple statistical learning method performs well using simulated training data, inferring parameters to within 10\% accuracy. In the process, we introduce spatial analogues of common population genetics statistics, and discuss how and why they are expected to contain signal about the geography of population dynamics that are key for ecological modeling generally and conservation of endangered taxa.},

@article{li2016local,
  abstract = {Population structure leads to systematic patterns in measures of mean relatedness between individuals in large genomic datasets, which are often discovered and visualized using dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA). Mean relatedness is an average of the relationships across locus-specific genealogical trees, which can be strongly affected on intermediate genomic scales by linked selection and other factors, We show how to use local principal components analysis to describe this meso-scale heterogeneity in patterns of relatedness, and apply the method to genomic data from three species, finding in each that the effect of population structure can vary substantially across only a few megabases. In a global human dataset, localized heterogeneity is likely explained by polymorphic chromosomal inversions. In a range-wide dataset of Medicago truncatula, factors that produce heterogeneity are shared between chromosomes, correlate with local gene density, and may be caused by background selection or local adaptation. In a dataset of primarily African Drosophila melanogaster, large-scale heterogeneity across each chromosome arm is explained by known chromosomal inversions thought to be under recent selection, and after removing samples carrying inversions, remaining heterogeneity is correlated with recombination rate and gene density, again suggesting a role for linked selection. The visualization method provides a flexible new way to discover biological drivers of genetic variation, and its application to data highlights the strong effects that linked selection and chromosomal inversions can have on observed patterns of genetic variation.},

IBE represents one of the most important patterns that results from the ways in which landscape heterogeneity influences gene flow and population connectivity, but it has only recently been examined in studies of ecological and landscape genetics. Nevertheless, the study of IBE presents valuable opportunities to investigate how spatial heterogeneity in ecological processes, agents of selection and environmental variables contributes to genetic divergence in nature. New and increasingly sophisticated studies of IBE in natural systems are poised to make significant contributions to our understanding of the role of ecology in genetic divergence and of modes of differentiation both within and between species. Here, we describe the underlying ecological processes that can generate patterns of IBE, examine its implications for a wide variety of disciplines and outline several areas of future research that can answer pressing questions about the ecological basis of genetic diversity.},
