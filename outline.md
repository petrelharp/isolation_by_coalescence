# Are populations like a circuit? The relationship between isolation by distance and isolation by resistance.

# Intro

- isolation by distance
- uses of resistance distance

# Methods

- why genetic distance is coalescence, not commute, time (and why resistance distance = commute time)
- computing hitting times of Markov chains (brief)
- solving for commute time
- solving for coalescence time
- nonuniqueness: simple example and math theory
- MCMC method (brief)
- example graphs and simulations

# Results

- coalescent times work better than commute times: comparing the two on the four types of graph (Fig 20)
- biased migration is bad for commute times: figure 19 showing the two against each other, and the simple example
- continuous space: can find big barriers but lots of between-replicate variability (life is still hard)
- tortoises: results on small graph, showing strong asymmetry (?)

# Conclusion

- resistance distance can mislead, especially in the presence of biased migration
- coalescence time analogue is feasible but more computationally intensive
- practical example (tortoises) shows strong asymmetry
- but methods dealing with ill-posedness are necessary
